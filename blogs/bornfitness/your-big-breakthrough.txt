"It’s not going to go how you think.\nYour big breakthrough won’t be shocking to most.\nOthers might even believe you’re hiding your “secret.”\nThere are no secrets to better health. At least, not the type you typically hear.\nYour big breakthrough will look like consistency, require support, and feel like habit.\nIt will push you towards doable behaviors and away from measures that are extreme for you.\nYou might think that finding one workout or food will change everything.\nYou’re told that’s when the weight comes off, and then the dark cloud will leave.\nIt’s all an illusion.\nYour big breakthrough will hit when you stop looking for the one thing.\nWhen you separate appearance from pain.\nWhen you no longer connect the mirror to your identity.\nYour appearance is not who you are.\nOr what you’re about.\nYour identity is built on intention and purpose.\nAnd your health is a byproduct of what you think of yourself.\nYou must believe.\nIn you.\nAt all times.\nIn all situations.\nIn all body types.\nShifting your mindset will allow you to improve your health and change your body (if that’s your goal).\nIt’s not the other way around.\nYour big breakthrough is learning to explore what holds you back.\nIt’s a process that doesn’t start with exercise selection or food choice.\nYour big breakthrough is realizing you have struggles. We all do.\nThose struggles do not mean you are weak or broken.\nAwareness is the spark of strength and awakening.\nIt will light a path to breaking down what stands in your way.\nYour big breakthrough comes by accepting yourself — at your best and your worst.\nIt’s learning to not throw in the towel when nothing seems to work.\nRealizing the bad days are part of being human.\nAnd letting go of perfectionist goals.\nIt’s about accepting the dual existence of struggles and successes.\nAnd knowing that both have their place in your life.\nYour big breakthrough is realizing it’s not about looking good.\nIt’s about living well.\nBy your standards.\nOn your terms.\nAnd, in a way that allows you to make the most of your days.\nYour big breakthrough will occur when the pain of your current situation is greater than the pain it takes to change.\nWhen you believe that the person you can become is more than just an illusion.\nYour big breakthrough, when it happens, won’t result in discomfort.\nIt will make you feel like everything is finally in the right place.\nAdam BornsteinAdam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and, according to The Huffington Post, “one of the most inspiring sources in all of health and fitness.” An award-winning writer and editor, Bornstein was the Fitness and Nutrition editor for Men’s Health, Editorial Director at LIVESTRONG.com, and a columnist for SHAPE, Men’s Fitness, and Muscle & Fitness.
