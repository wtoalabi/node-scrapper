"Life should include dessert.\nTo help set healthy habits around dessert (or any food) bring more intention.\nSpend time preparing it as an event rather than standing by the freezer with a spoon in the pint of ice cream. Making dessert a ritual instead of a knee-jerk reaction pulls you into the present moment and allows you to experience dessert with all of your senses.\nBringing Your Intention\n\nPrepare the table by clearing the space, lighting a candle, turned off electronics, turn on music.\nBe hands-on by elevating even simple desserts with elements of fresh fruit, dusting of spices and herbs, or serving on a special plate.\nInvite your friends/family to sit and have a conversation. Conversation cards are great for this!\n\nIngredients\n\n10 Phyllo Dough sheets (not puffed pastry which has a lot more fat)\n1 Egg white\n1 tablespoon sugar + cinnamon, combined\nHalo Top Vanilla Bean Ice cream\nFresh blackberries\nConfectionary sugar (optional)\n\nDirections\n\nPreheat oven to 375.\nOn a baking sheet lined with parchment paper lay out 5 phyllo dough sheets.\nBrush with egg white.\nSprinkle a few pinches of sugar + cinnamon mix.\nAdd 5 more sheets and repeat.\nBake 10 minutes or until edges start to turn lightly golden.\nCut cooked dough into desired shapes.\nServe with fresh fruit, ice cream, and dust of confectionary sugar.\n\nÂ \n\nNatalie SabinNatalie is a M.S. in Nutrition & Performance candidate; anticipated completion December 2021.
