To read the full article, click here.\nWeight Loss Research on Glycemic Index\nReview showing a slight benefit of low GI or low GL diets, only summing up to (at most) 15lbs of weight gain over 20 years.\nAlmost no difference in outcomes for 36 weeks of low-glycemic load diet in obese\nNo difference on health outcomes of high or low GI diet over 5 weeks\nRelationship of GI to markers of health unclear\nNo differences in outcomes between low and high GI diets over 10 weeks (including satiety)\nReview indicating some benefit in weight loss for low glycemic diets\n2013 review indicating no anthropometric (fat loss included) differences between high and low glycemic index and load diets (This is the biggest nail in the coffin right here, as it’s a comprehensive review and is recent)\nWeight Loss Research On Food Reward\nOverall review of the food reward hypothesis\nAdditional research here\nIncreased Hunger and Slowed Metabolism\nExtreme levels of overeating when high palatability food is presented\nEnergy restriction (for a whole year) shows only small (yet significant) declines in metabolic rate\nWeight Loss Research and Metabolic Changes\nMASSIVE weight loss rates (18kg in only 12 weeks) resulted in 67% of the weight loss predicted from NO metabolic adaptations. Thus, the idea that a slowed metabolism could account for a stoppage of weight loss is not in evidence. Furthermore, not all of the difference is explained by metabolic rate slowdown, further weakening its explanatory role in preventing weight loss\nMetabolic changes only account for 120 calories–on average–of difference in metabolism during dieting, on average\nStudy showing 230 calories lower metabolism for a diet of 700 calories lower than maintenance levels (obviously not enough to stall weightloss)\nThe Yo-Yo Effect: Weight Regain\nWeight regain occurs often, strategies to help it unclear\nReview of behavioral interventions on weight regain show only small benefits\nWeight regain for most diets highly common, solutions unclear\nWeight Loss and Blood Sugar\nObese people have HIGHER blood glucose levels and HIGHER blood fat levels, not lower\nLow-Carb Diets vs. Low-Fat Diets vs. Calorie Intake\nBoth low-fat and lowcarb nutrition plans work, no clear winner in this study either\nPossible slight edge to low-carb, but results largely equivocal\nNo meaningful difference in weight loss of low-fat and low-carb\nIn controlled settings, most popular diets work about the same if they restrict energy to the same extent\nThe Science of Obesity\nFat went down only a small amount over time, carbs and calories up by a bunch\nPercent of energy from fat decreased by only 3% from 1971-2006, but obesity went up 20%\nVegetarians and vegans take in much more carbohydrate, but are less overweigh than omnivores\nAdam BornsteinAdam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and, according to The Huffington Post, “one of the most inspiring sources in all of health and fitness.” An award-winning writer and editor, Bornstein was the Fitness and Nutrition editor for Men’s Health, Editorial Director at LIVESTRONG.com, and a columnist for SHAPE, Men’s Fitness, and Muscle & Fitness.
