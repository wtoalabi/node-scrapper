"Wild Thang Workout:\nThe 20-Minute, Fat-Crushing Circuit\nBy Jen Sinkler\nGlance around most gyms and you’ll see people taking their exercise quite seriously. Or maybe more appropriately, they take themselves quite seriously. Solemn faces. Averted eyes. And if you like it that way, if the gym is your place to go inward, carry on.\nBut if you want your training time to feel more like playtime, try incorporating more ground-based movements and crawling patterns, especially with fat-loss workouts.\nA bonus perk: Such cross-patterned (opposite-hand, opposite-foot) movements may even build new synapses in the brain, in effect making you smarter when you crawl around like a child. (It might sound crazy, but think about it’s still a basic movement pattern that most of us have abandoned since we were just one-year-old children.)\nIf you’re not sold on the mental aspect, do it for the muscular endurance you’ll build in your shoulders and upper back.\nTo be clear, this is not to say you’re cutting out the big weights — not a chance. Build circuits like these into your program one to three times a week. Below, I’ve laid out a quick, effective and enjoyable total-body circuit workout called “The Zoo.” Get ready to escape.\n“The Zoo”\nTime Allotted: 20 minutes, allowing for rest between circuits\nSuggested Equipment: Two dumbbells and the urge to prowl\nInstructions: Complete all rounds of each circuit before moving on to the next, working for 30 seconds and resting for 30 seconds. Take additional rest if needed (but try to take it at the bottom of the round).\n\nDouble Front Squat\n\n\nAssume a racked position with the dumbbells at shoulder height, your forearms vertical under the dumbbells.\nInitiate the squat by pushing your butt backward and bending your knees, keeping your torso upright and supporting the weight with your arms.\nKeep your knees in line with your toes as you lower yourself as far as you are comfortably able. (If it’s not very far, play with foot position, and try turning your toes slightly outward, but don’t force anything.)\nAgain, keeping your knees in line with your feet, return to stand in the starting position and repeat.\n\nMonkey Hustle\n\n\nSquat low to the floor, keeping your arms in front of your body.\nSwing both arms over to one side and reach until you can plant your hands firmly on the floor.\nAs your hands make contact with the floor, gently leap the same direction, landing softly, feet farther over than your hands.\nKeep traveling laterally, alternating the reach and hop portions of the movement.\n\nDouble Romanian Deadlift\n\nStand tall and grasp two dumbbells so they hang down in front of you against your thighs.\nKeeping your chest up, hinge at the hips and allow the dumbbells to trail down the front of your legs, keeping them as close to your body as possible.\nWhen you reach the end of the range of motion — typically felt as a stretch in the hamstrings or a change in back position — reverse the movement and stand up.\n\nSnatch\n\n\nStand tall and place a dumbbell between your feet in front of you so the handle is perpendicular to your feet.\nKeeping your back flat, hinge at the hips and bend your knees until you can reach the dumbbell handle.\nGripping the dumbbell, explosively extend your hips. Use the power generated by your hip drive to lift the dumbbell. Keep the dumbbell close to your body as it rises, and pull only slightly with your arm.\nAs the dumbbell passes your face level, extend and “punch” your arm upward to lock the weight out overhead. The weight should feel weightless for a moment at the top of the movement. If you are pressing out to complete the movement, use a lighter weight or explode more powerfully from the hips.\nLower the dumbbell with control to the floor, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions before switching sides.\n\nBear Crawl\n\nStarting on your hands and knees, rise up onto your toes and tighten your core.\nAt the same time, reach forward with your right hand and left foot and then return your hand and foot to the floor.\nAlternate hands and feet, always in opposites, in a crawling pattern for desired distance or time.\n\nGet Better Faster\nIf you’re looking to amp up your conditioning in other creative but productive ways, check out Jen’s Lift Weights Faster, a complete guide of more than 130 workouts, 225 exercises, a video library, five challenge-workout videos, plus a dynamic warm-up routine.
