"Not every food needs to be a diet food or low calorie.\nWhen it comes to building muscle it isn’t about hammering lots of protein to build mass—it is about adequate calories + stimulation from training (and of course some protein). If you are a hard gainer, eating enough calories every day can feel like work. There are times when you might need a higher-calorie food that isn’t bulky or makes you feel stuffed. In this situation, ideal foods are calorie-dense and light in the stomach so you don’t feel weighed down.\nThese Cacao Tahini Rice Crispy Treats are a healthier spin on traditional rice crispy treats but will still satisfy that sweet tooth.\nIngredients:\n\n4 cups rice crispy cereal\n1/2 cup cacao nibs\n1 cup tahini\n1 tbsp coconut oil\n1/4 cup honey (less if you want it less sweet)\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n8×9 glass baking dish\nParchment paper\n\nDirections\n\nCombine cereal and cocoa nibs in a large bowl.\nIn a small saucepan on medium-low heat whisk together tahini, coconut oil, honey, and vanilla extract for one minute until smooth.\nPour Tahini mixture over cereal.

Using another dish or a glass press the cereal down firmly.\nPlace in the freezer for one hour before cutting into nine equals squares.\nWrap each individually and place in the freezer refrigerator for when you’re ready.\n\nCalories/Macros\n1 serving = 1 square\nAppropriately: Calories 230, protein 5g, carbs 24g fat 13g, fiber 3g\nFor a step-by-step video, check out the Born Fitness Instagram\n\n \nNatalie SabinNatalie is a M.S. in Nutrition & Performance candidate; anticipated completion December 2021.
