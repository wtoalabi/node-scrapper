"It’s easy to commit to anything. It’s something few people are willing to admit. Because it’s not the commitment that matters.\nYou can commit to a workout program or a diet, and begin with the best intentions. \nBut, what do you owe those plans? Absolutely nothing. \nIf you let down the plan, it’s frustrating. But, it doesn’t hurt. \nCommitment alone has limited value. \nThat’s why many committed people don’t succeed.\nIf you want to change, you need to attach your commitment to your soul. Or, at least it should feel that way.\nIt has to be deeply personal. \nIt needs to operate at a different level. \nEffective commitments are a paradox. They are an uncomfortable mix of fear, excitement, optimism, pessimism, and insecurity. \nThat’s where you find the breakthroughs.\nSelf-improvement lives within everyone, but it’s usually buried under uncertainty, self-sabotage, or prior failure.\nTo make commitment work, you need to be willing to risk something valuable.\nWhen you are ready to change, connect to more than what you want to change. \nFocus on who you want to become, or what you fail to lose if you don’t follow through on your commitment.\nSet stakes. Create reminders. \nThat is where you will find your will to succeed. \nAdam BornsteinAdam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and, according to The Huffington Post, “one of the most inspiring sources in all of health and fitness.” An award-winning writer and editor, Bornstein was the Fitness and Nutrition editor for Men’s Health, Editorial Director at LIVESTRONG.com, and a columnist for SHAPE, Men’s Fitness, and Muscle & Fitness.
