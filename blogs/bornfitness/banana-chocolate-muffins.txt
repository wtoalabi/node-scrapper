And most importantly, so delicious.\nWhy it’s a Healthy Recipe\nThese banana chocolate muffins are full of fiber, healthy fats and food-sourced protein, this muffin is a macronutrient balanced on-the-go meal.\nThe combination of Greek yogurt and egg whites make this a great high-protein snack (if you have at least 2-3 muffins). And the fiber-packed oats are great any weight-management regime because they help slow down digestion, which keeps you feeling full for longer.\nAnd although most oats contain gluten—gasp!—the USDA claims that oats are essential in a heart-healthy diet, lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. (Or you could just use a gluten-free option if you have a gluten allergy.)\nBanana Chocolate Muffins\nYields: 12 muffins\nCook time: 25 minutes\nDifficulty: Easy\nServing size: 1 muffin\nWet ingredients\n\n2 smashed extra ripe bananas, yields about 3/4 cup\n1/4c non-fat Greek yogurt\n1 tbsp. all-natural almond butter\n1 tbsp. melted coconut oil (unrefined, cold-filtered)\n1 c liquid egg whites\n1 tsp. vanilla extract\n1 tbsp. raw, unfiltered honey\n\nDry ingredients\n\n1/2c oat flour + 1/4c old fashion oats\n1 tsp. baking powder\n1 tsp. baking soda\n1 tbsp. granular sugar substitute*\n¼ tsp. sea salt\n1/4 tsp. cinnamon\n1/4c slivered almonds\n2 tbsp. dark chocolate chips**\n\n*We used Swerve, erythritol-based sugar substitute.\n**We used Enjoy Life dairy-, soy- and nut-free, semi-sweet chocolate chips.\n Directions\n1.
