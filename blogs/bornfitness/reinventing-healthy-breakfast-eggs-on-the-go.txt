"A protein-packed recipe that removes the need to spend time cooking first thing in the morning.\nIf you’re like most people, a good meal plan feels like an essential component of your healthy diet equation. That is, until it’s 7 am and you’re scrambling around with no idea what to make for breakfast.\nWhile missing breakfast is not a sure fire way to kill your plan, for most people, messing up the first meal is the first domino that leads to a day of frustrated eating. What good is a plan if it’s not realistic to follow?\nLet’s change that.\nYou know that “life happens.” Most of us don’t have enough time in the morning to make healthy and satisfying breakfasts, so we usually reach for a processed bar, toast or nothing at all.\nHaving an easy to grab-and-go breakfast means you don’t have to rely on willpower, don’t have to rush to find something to eat, and maybe most importantly, you won’t sweat starting your day in a frustrating way.\nThis easy eggs recipe, created by Born Fitness meal prep specialist Liv Langdon, founder of Liv Lang & Prosper, offers two very good reasons to dig in: it tastes awesome and you don’t have to make it in the morning. Prep these at any time, and you can eat them cold or pop them in the microwave and they’re good to go.\nThis small adjust provides a simpler equation for better results: Little prep + protein-packed + added vegetables = a convenient breakfast anyone can enjoy.\nIngredients\n\n2c chopped spinach\n1/3c sweet onion, thinly sliced\n1/2c chopped Portobello mushrooms\n2 slices uncured, nitrate-free turkey bacon, diced\n1 ½ cup 100% liquid egg whites\n3 whole eggs\n¼ tsp ground black pepper\n¼ tsp Himalayan sea salt\n¼ tsp ground garlic powder\n1/3 c shaved, grated Parmesan Reggiano cheese\n\nDirections\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.\nLine muffin pans with 12 baking [muffin] cups. Spray cups with a non-stick—preferably olive or coconut oil—spray.\nIn a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and egg whites. In a separate, larger bowl, combine the remainder of the ingredients except for the Parmesan. Spoon the “batter” into each muffin cup until it’s ¾ of the way full. The muffins puff up a little when they’re cooking. Also, try to make sure to spoon an equal representation of all ingredients in each muffin (because it’s only fair). Sprinkle ½ tbsp. of the Parmesan shavings on top of each one.\nBake for 25-30 minutes or until fully cooked and the Parmesan has slightly browned on top.\nRemove from oven and let cool slightly for 5 to 10 minutes. Enjoy warm, or pack a few in Tupperware containers for an easy, grab-and-go breakfast bite.\nMakes 12 muffin bites and can last up to one week in an airtight container in the fridge.\n\n\nNutritional Information & Macros\nDietary Information Low-carb, Gluten-free, Paleo (depending on the individual restrictions and the type of turkey bacon), Nut-free\n**If you want dairy-free, simply remove the cheese.\nMacros per serving (1 muffin)\n51.9 calories\n2.14g fat\n0.95g carbs\n6.92g protein\nTotal breakdown for 12 servings\neggs: 210 calories, 15g fat, 0g carbs, 18g protein\negg whites: 189 calories, 0.6g fat, 2.6g carbs, 39g protein\nspinach: 14 calories, 0.2g fat, 2g carbs, 1.6g protein\nmushrooms: 20 calories, 0g fat, 3g carbs, 3g protein\nonion: 15 calories, 0g fat, 3g carbs, 0g protein\nturkey bacon: 70 calories, 3g fat, 0g carbs, 12g protein\nparmesan: 105 calories, 6.85g fat, 0.85g carbs, 9.45g protein\ntotal: 623 calories, 25.65g fat, 11.45g carbs, 83.05g protein\nREAD MORE: \nHow Many Eggs are Safe to Eat?\nPeanut Butter Banana Protein Overnight Oats\nHigh Protein Sweet Potato Chili\nAdam BornsteinAdam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and, according to The Huffington Post, “one of the most inspiring sources in all of health and fitness.” An award-winning writer and editor, Bornstein was the Fitness and Nutrition editor for Men’s Health, Editorial Director at LIVESTRONG.com, and a columnist for SHAPE, Men’s Fitness, and Muscle & Fitness.
