"Lots of people go to the gym. And yet, about 60 to 80 percent of memberships go unused. There are many reasons why, but no doubt part of it has to do with the environment. With that in mind, I polled people who follow me on Twitter and Facebook to determine what “#gymrules” you would like to see instituted at every fitness facility. This compilation of responses serves as, “The People’s Gym Rules.”\nI’ve included two lists: The first covers basic rules that were most commonly shared or retweeted on social. The second list includes (some bitter) responses that were too entertaining not to acknowledge.\nThe 12 Rules of the Gym (Social Media Edition)\nRule 1: Be gym-kind.
