"Sometimes you need a hug. Other times, you just need a brownie.\nWhile we believe that desserts and snacks are a part of life, it’s understandable if some people want healthier versions of their favorite desserts. The trick: make substitutions that might sound like they won’t work, but when you taste the final product, you’ll never even realize the changes you made. Which is why we create things like protein ice cream or this recipe, espresso chocolate brownies.\nThis brownie recipe is a flourless version of the classic dessert. A traditional brownie is roughly 250 calories. This “healthy” recipe is about 60 percent fewer calories without any added sugar.\nEnjoy these delicious treats to satisfy your nighttime cravings or store in the fridge and pack it in your lunch for a midday snack to keep you far (far) away from the break room donuts.\nWhy it’s a Healthy Recipe\nBlack beans—not-your-average main brownie ingredient—are a staple protein source for many non-meat eaters. Translation: you can eat more than one serving without loading up on too many calories. These legumes are also high in fiber, which helps aid digestion, and a great source of folic acid, magnesium, potassium, and iron.\nAnd while coconut oil (the new Windex in My Big Fat Greek Wedding—it cures everything!) is overhyped, it does offer some health benefits. It’s loaded with lauric acid, a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) that accounts for about half of the fat in coconut oil, which might help improve HDL (good) cholesterol.\nChocolate Brownies: The Ingredients\n\nServing size: 16 servings\nCook time: 25 minutes\nDifficulty: Easy\n\n1 15-oz can black beans, drained\n1/3 c virgin, unrefined, cold-filtered coconut oil, melted\n3 tbsp. cacao powder*\n2 tsp. vanilla extract\n1 ½ tbsp. instant coffee\n1 ½ tsp. baking powder\n¼ tsp. sea salt,\n2 egg (for more fudge-like consistency, use 1 egg)\n1/3 c coconut milk\n¼ c Truvia**\n1 scoop chocolate protein powder, optional\n1 tsp. honey, optional\n½ c dark chocolate chips\n\n*Cocoa powder is an equally good substitute.\n** I like the way Truvia bakes, but feel free to substitute with other sweeteners; I just can’t vouch for the taste.\nDirections for (“Healthier”) Chocolate Brownies\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.\nDrain and rinse the black beans very thoroughly. This is one of those steps you don’t want to skip. Rinsing with water with strip away the preservatives used in canning and help get rid of that funky black bean taste.\nAdd all ingredients except for the chocolate chips in a blender or food processor.
