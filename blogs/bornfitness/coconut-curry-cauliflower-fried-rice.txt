"It’s not secret that I love rice. And I eat it all the time because as I try to remind people, carbs are not bad. That said, I do realize that there are limitations on how many carbs people can eat, and when that occurs it’d be great to eat carb-like meals that offer a little more dieting flexibility. Which is why I was so intrigued when fitness journalist Olivia Langdon sent this recipe my way. And once I gave it a try, it was everything I hoped it would be. Dig in on this unique take on “fried rice.” Don’t be deceived by the cauliflower base, it’s still plenty flavorful. And for more recipes from Langdon, be sure to check out her site. Plenty of good, nutritious food. -AB\nBorn Fitness Recipes: Coconut Curry Cauliflower Fried Rice\nIngredients\n\n1-pound package ground grass fed beef\n1 large head of cauliflower, chopped to “rice size” pieces, food processor works best here\n1 zucchini, diced\n1 squash, diced\n1 carrot, diced\n1 onion, diced\n3 large eggs\nSrirachi\nBragg’s Liquid Aminos\nCoconut oil (look for unrefined, cold-pressed and extra virgin)\nUnsweetened shredded coconut\nSpices: ginger, curry, turmeric\n\nDirections\n\nBlanch the chopped zucchini, squash and carrots in pot of boiling water.
