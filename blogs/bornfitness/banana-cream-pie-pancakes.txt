"Confession time. Most high-protein pancake recipes taste artifice to me, but I still wanted to bump my protein up at breakfast.\nWhich is why I created these High Protein Banana Cream Pie Pancakes.\nWhy I love it: Adding protein from yogurt plus fruit is more filling than just pancakes alone, which means fewer pancakes and more satiating whole food—but doesn’t sacrificing flavor. Tastes like pie.\nIngredients\n\nGluten-free pancake mix, cook according to package directions\n1 cup plain Greek Yogurt (I use Kirkland brand with 18g of protein per serving)\nBanana slices\nDrizzle of 100% pure organic maple syrup\n\nDirections\nLayer two 4″ gluten-free pancakes with yogurt. Top with banana slices and a drizzle of pure maple syrup.\n\n \nNatalie SabinNatalie is a M.S. in Nutrition & Performance candidate; anticipated completion December 2021.
