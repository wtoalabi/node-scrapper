"Some foods sound too good to be healthy. Lucky for you, flavor has never been dependent on added sugars or other additives that make you feel guilty about what you’re eating. In a world of carb-fear, any type of wrap or bread-based product receives an unfair reputation as “fattening.” Nothing could bar farther from the truth. Enter the buffalo chicken quesadilla.\nThis recipe is the definition of balance: a good source of carbs from the tortilla, a protein-packed (and flavorful) boost from the buffalo chicken, and some monounsaturated-rich avocado, and you have a meal that fits any macronutrient plan.\nThe bonus: the shredded buffalo chicken is versatile for many different recipes. Make lettuce wraps for a great gluten-free snack at work; serve as a dip with carrots, celery or rice chips at the next party; or, wrap it up and grill the outside for added crunch.\nStep 1: How to Make Buffalo Chicken\nIngredients\n\n4 chicken breasts\n1 ½ c Frank’s hot sauce\nDash of each of the following:\nOnion powder\nGarlic powder\nChili powder\n\nDirections\n\nRinse and trim the fat off four chicken breasts.\nIn a slow cooker (CrockPot), add all ingredients.\nCook on high for 3 to 4 hours, or on low for 5 to 6 hours.\nUsing a fork shred the chicken.\nPut aside and let cool.\n\n\nStep 2: How to Make Buffalo Chicken Quesadillas\nIngredients\n\n3-4 oz.
