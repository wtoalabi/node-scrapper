"The Art of Quick Meals\nThe reason many people feel they can eat healthily is they don’t believe they have time to cook.\nAnd I get it—I am a mom of two, wife, have a job, working on my master’s, plus all the other demands life throws my way.\nIt is why I am dedicated to creating easy meals, simple recipes, and sharing shortcuts that I use in my own kitchen.\nToday’s shortcut: Frozen Mahi-Mahi fillets.\nWhy I love it: keep them on hand so you are never without a protein source. Mild flavor and don’t taste “fishy” or stink up the house. Mahi-Mahi is “Meaty” and that means filling. They can be thawed in a bowl of cool water in 15 minutes if you forgot to take them out of the freezer (like I ALWAYS do).\nFrozen Mahi-Mahi Fillets Directions\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees\nPlace thawed fillet(s) on a lined baking sheet\nSprinkle both sides with your favorite dry spices (I like webergrill Savory Herbs w/ Roasted Garlic seasoning mix)\nA small hit of butter if that is your jam.\nCook for 10-12 minutes.\n\nTip: Makes great fish tacos with jicama slaw\n\nNatalie SabinNatalie is a M.S. in Nutrition & Performance candidate; anticipated completion December 2021.
