"In the world of “healthy” options, it’s rare that you’ll find a vegetable that can offer that combination salty and sweet, along with a crunchy texture. But that’s exactly what’s delivered in this recipe, created by Liv Langdon, founder of Liv Lang & Prosper, and a Born Fitness meal prep specialist.\nOn the nutrition side, Brussels sprouts are loaded with fiber, are a great source of the B vitamins, and contain glucosinolates, which show promise in fighting cancer. Need another reason? One word for you: bacon. We use turkey bacon in this version, but the original stuff works just as well.\nIngredients\n\n2-lb bag of Brussels sprouts\n1 apple (I used Fuji here)\n3 slices turkey bacon, nitrate free and uncured (feel free to substitute if vegetarian)\n¼ cup slivered almonds\n2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil,\n½ tsp Himalayan sea salt\n¼ tsp pepper\n½ tsp garlic powder \n\nBecause anything with bacon can be delicious.\nDirections\n\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees.\nTrim the Brussels sprouts and cut into halves. Make sure to wash them first.\nSlice the apples and turkey bacon into small chunks. The shapes and size of the chunks don’t matter; just have fun with it.\nIn a large bowl, combine the chopped Brussels sprouts, the sliced apples and sliced bacon, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Toss until fully coated.\nOn a baking tray, spread Brussels sprout mixture flat.\nBake for 35-40 minutes until the Brussels sprouts are brown, crisp and tender.\nRemove from the oven and sprinkle the almond slivers on top. Bake for another five minutes until the almonds are lightly toasted brown.\nServe warm as a side dish. It even tastes good cold in a packed lunch on the go.\n\nNutrition Information & Macros\nDietary information: Gluten-free, lactose and dairy free.
