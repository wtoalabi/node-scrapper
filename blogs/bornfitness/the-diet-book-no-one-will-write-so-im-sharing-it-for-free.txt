"I’m the author of 9 books that have been published by large publishing houses. Six of the titles have my name, and another three have been ghost-written. And all of those would be considered a “diet book.”\nFrom New York Times best sellers to one that fell far short of expectations, I’ve realized that while many books have some good information, they overcomplicate the message that really needs to be spread. I’ve read books on everything from why we gain fat to how to build muscle, low-carb diets to “magic bullet” protein trends, and even how to live longer and fight disease.\nWhat I learned was that despite some great information, we were missing the bigger picture. So I put together the world’s simplest book proposal, which has been rejected over…and over…and over again.\nA big reason so many people struggle with diet and exercise is because the majority of diet and exercise books have overcomplicated the real issues.\nAt first, I thought it was me. Maybe my ideas are stupid. Then again, three of my books have been “best sellers,” and one of them even hit #4 of the New York Times best seller list.\nThen I saw this message the other day on Facebook.\nEverything that’s wrong with the diet industry\nAnd I realized that some people don’t need another book. They just need information, some clarity and direction, and the occasional cheese sandwich.\nBecause no one will publish my simple book concept (which works), I’m sharing the lessons for free to fight back against ideas like activated charcoal (no, it won’t detox your body) and every other ridiculous, money-driven cause that has a terrible ROI for your health.\nSolving The Diet Book Crisis\nThe hook: A big reason so many people struggle with diet and exercise is because the majority of diet and exercise books have overcomplicated the important issues, resulting in more stress and worry, billions of dollars spent on supplements, and creating inaccurate scapegoats (Carbs, dietary fat, gluten, lactose, “toxins”, laziness, dessert, etc.) that inevitably lead to diet failure and learned helplessness.\nThe result: too many people feel their bodies are broken, nothing can change, and internally they struggle with how they look and feel.\nWant a better, healthier life? Forget what you’ve learned and just apply these 10 simple lessons. \n\n\nSleep.\n\n\nSmile.\n\n\nEat proteins, vegetables, and fats.\n\n\nDrink water.\n\n\nIgnore all detoxes, cleanses, and magic pills. Save your $$\n\n\nAccept that there is NOT “one problem” that causes weight gain or makes weight loss difficult.\n\n\nHave sex.\n\n\nMove/exercise to fight stress—the type of exercise is your choice, but do it often.\n\n\nBe good to others.\n\n\nEmbrace imperfection, with diet, exercise, and even your appearance. It’s OK. You’re human. Bad days happen. -Repeat often. \n\n\nSure, it’s short. But when the advice is applied to my clients, I’ve seen crazy results. Since no publisher wants it, you can take it for free.
