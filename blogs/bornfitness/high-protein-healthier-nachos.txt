"When you think nachos, the last thing that probably comes to mind is “healthy.” Maybe it’s the chips, the cheese, the sour cream, and more topping than you can imagine. (Did I mention the cheese?)\nNachos don’t have to be a bad snack. In fact, they can be a protein loaded meal, if you make them the right way and are willing to make a few substitutions that maintain the taste but sacrifice some nutritional gut bombs (the type you don’t want). These are protein packed nachos. Perfect for a snack and always good for any sporting event.\nBorn Fitness Recipes: High Protein Healthier Nachos\nIngredients\nPrep time: About 30-35 minutes (can be quicker with multiple hands)\n(Serves about 4 people)\n\n4 ounces of tortilla chips (buy whatever kind you want. Honestly. The amount is the issue here)\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n12 ounces black beans\n½ cup sweet corn\n¼ cup diced onions\n2 medium sized sweet potatoes\n1 jalapeño pepper, sliced thin\n1 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1 teaspoon cumin\n1 teaspoon chili powder\n¾-1 pound ground beef or turkey\n3 stalks scallions, diced\nSalt (sprinkle on as desired)\n1/3 cup shredded cheese of your choice (optional)\n\nGuacamole Ingredients\n\n2 ripe avocados, peeled, pitted\n3/4 cup chopped tomatoes\n1 jalapeño pepper, diced\n1/2 cup cilantro leaves\n1/4 cup chopped onion\n2 Tablespoons lemon juice\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon garlic\n\nDirections: How to Make Healthier Nachos\nPrepare the meat\nIn a large skillet (coat with butter or coconut oil), cook and stir the ground beef over medium-high heat, breaking the meat up as it cooks, until the meat is no longer pink and has started to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the onions, cayenne, cumin, and chili powder and cook for about 5 more minutes. \nPrepare the sweet potatoes\nThe long version\nSet an oven for 375 degrees. Wash and cut the potatoes into thin slices. Place on a pan, drizzle in olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and bake for 30 minutes.\nThe quick version\nWash the sweet potatoes and pierce a few times with a fork. Then wrap the potatoes with a paper towel and microwave for 4-5 minutes. Once cooled, turn a grill on medium-high heat, cut the potatoes into thin slices, drizzle in olive oil, and place on the grill for 2-3 minutes per side.\nThe beans and corn\nHeat over medium high heat on a skillet, or follow the microwaveable instructions to prepare ASAP!\nThe Guacamole\nI like my guacamole made fast and served chunky, so for that I’ve found that the Vitamix blender turns me into a much better chef. If you don’t have a Vitamix, just use any blender. Or apply right here to win a free one. All part of theBorn Fitness monthly giveaway experience.\n\nPlace all ingredients into the Vitamix container in the order listed and secure lid.\nSelect to blender level 1 for about 5 seconds and then more to speed 3.\nBlend for 15-20 seconds, using the tamper to mix ingredients into the blades.\nMake sure no raw ingredients are on the sides, scrap down, blend for another 5-10 seconds and serve. I enjoy my guacamole to be thick and chunky and not too smooth. If you want it creamier, simple blend longer. Add to nachos or use as a dip.\n\nIt’s Alive! Protein-Packed Nachos\nOn a large platter, lay out the chips in a single layer. Top with the sweet potato wedges or create another thin layer. Then add the ground beef or turkey, and top with black beans and corn. Add the diced scallions and sliced jalapenos and sprinkle with salt, and then top with the guacamole.\n**If you want the cheese (I don’t add because I choose meat over cheese in my kosher universe) place a pat of butter in a skillet, add ¼ cup of milk, and then add ¼ cup of cheese of your choice. Whisk the mixture until smooth and then drizzle over your chips.\nAdam BornsteinAdam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and, according to The Huffington Post, “one of the most inspiring sources in all of health and fitness.” An award-winning writer and editor, Bornstein was the Fitness and Nutrition editor for Men’s Health, Editorial Director at LIVESTRONG.com, and a columnist for SHAPE, Men’s Fitness, and Muscle & Fitness.
