"People oftentimes think the best workouts cause the most soreness and pain.\nOr, the most effective diets bring about the most discomfort and misery.\nWhy do we believe better health requires constant suffering?\nChange can be associated with pain, but it’s not measured in soreness or restriction.\nSome workouts will make you hurt. Some diets will make you hungry. But, these adjustments should be — for the most part — temporary.\nWhen you start from scratch, begin a new plan, or have taken time off, almost anything you do can create friction or discomfort.

You’re actually crawling deeper into the dark.\nAdam BornsteinAdam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and, according to The Huffington Post, “one of the most inspiring sources in all of health and fitness.” An award-winning writer and editor, Bornstein was the Fitness and Nutrition editor for Men’s Health, Editorial Director at LIVESTRONG.com, and a columnist for SHAPE, Men’s Fitness, and Muscle & Fitness.
