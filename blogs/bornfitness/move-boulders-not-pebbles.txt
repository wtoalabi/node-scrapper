"How much do you focus on adding superfoods to your diet? \nWhat about counting the hours you fast, making sure you don’t eat 5 minutes before your 16-hour intermittent fasting window is up? \nDo you choose your workouts by obsessing over the “best” exercises?\nThose details all count for something, but they are an illusion. \nThey say the devil is in the details. \nBut, in fitness and nutrition, sometimes the details act like the devil. \nThey trick you into focusing (and stressing) over minor decisions that don’t lead to major results. \nIf you want to change for the better, you can’t stress every decision.\nThat happens when you build your foundation. \nAnd before you build a foundation, you need to make sure the blueprint looks like the house you want to live in. \nI’ll say it a thousand times over: many plans work.
