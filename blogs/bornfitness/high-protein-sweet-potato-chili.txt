"In the pantheon of great all-purpose recipes, chili has to rank in the Top 10. It works as lunch, dinner, a snack, a side, and has so many variations that there’s something for everyone. Not to mention, if you have a slow cooker, it requires no cooking talent to make a delicious meal. (Note: I think everyone should own a slow cooker; has too much value and is possibly the easiest cooking device ever created.) You just need the wherewithal to throw ingredients in a pot 6 to 8 hours before you want to eat. Toss in the fact that you have to work to make it unhealthy, and it’s hard to argue against chili. This recipe is a Born Fitness special, as it tosses in one of my favorite ingredients: sweet potatoes.
