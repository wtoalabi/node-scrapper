"I had my big “aha” cooking moment in 2003 when I was watching Sandra Lee’s semi-homemade series on Food Network. Okay, well, the actual “aha” moment didn’t come until many years later since I was only 19, undergrad, and eating Ramen. The whole idea of the show was combining fresh ingredients with store-bought items. THIS IS GENIUS! Especially if you are juggling a full schedule (or don’t really like to cook), but want to eat healthily.\nFast forward 18 years and I am still leaning into the semi-homemade technique. Thanks, Sandra!\nAsian Chicken Bowl Ingredients \n\n1 Precooked rotisserie chicken, skin removed and cut into pieces\n1 bag or 4 cups pre-chopped coleslaw, no sauce (you find these with the bagged salad mix)\n1 bag frozen shelled edamame, thawed\nNoodles or rice of your choice, cooked (I like Udon noodles for this recipe)\n1 Tbsp Rice Vinegar\n1 Tbsp Sesame oil\n1-2 Tbsp Chili Sauce\n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n1 Tbsp Tahini\nGreen onion, chopped for topping\n\nHow To\n\nIn a large mixing bowl combine coleslaw, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.
