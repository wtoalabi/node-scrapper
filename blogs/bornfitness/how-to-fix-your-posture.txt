"The simple fixes you can make to end the pain  you feel when you stand, sit, or are even lying down.\nThe greatest lie ever told is that adding exercise will ensure your body will never hurt again.\nYes, a smart training plan can go a long way towards preventing injury and feeling great. But your hard work in the gym can be reversed if you don’t take care of yourself outside the weight room. This where you posture can do more damage than you realize.\nIf there’s anything I’ve heard over and over again, it’s that most people are constantly feeling achy. And the reason is obvious: you spend a lot more time outside the gym than in. Whether you’re on your feet or chained to a desk, the reality is life can be a pain in the back. Literally.\nYou spend the majority of your non-training time in one of three positions: standing, sitting, and lying. The goal is to minimize unnecessary muscle activity and imbalanced stress across your joints.\nThe following guidelines are meant to help put your body in a more efficient position and help you fix your posture without extra time in the gym.\nLess Pain When Standing\nThe Correct Position Checklist\n\nYour feet should be pointed straight ahead or out slightly.\nYour weight will ideally be evenly distributed across your entire foot, and make sure you’re not leaning to one side or another so that one foot takes on more weight.\nAnkles, knees, hips, shoulders, and ears are all in-line.\n\nCommon Flaws\n\nWeight shifted forward on your feet or more to one leg than the other\nYour upper back is slouched\nYour head is positioned forward/in front of your spine\n\nQuick Fix\nPerform three quick, small jumps. (Yes, it might look a little funny at a dinner party, so have a good story ready and waiting.)\nThe jumping should help align your feet and reestablish your balance, which will snap your body back into preferred and ideal posture.\nLess Pain When Sitting\nThe Correct Position Checklist\n\nFeet flat on ground pointed straight ahead or out slightly.\nYour hips flexed to roughly 90 degrees\nWeight evenly distributed on both sides of your butt\nHips, shoulders, and ears are all in-line.\nFace and eyes are oriented straight ahead.\n\nCommon Flaws\n\nOne leg crossed over the other\nWeighted shifted to one side more than the other\nUpper back slouched\nHead positioned forward of spine\nArms not supported\n\nQuick Fix\nPlace both feet on the floor, raise your arms overhead, and then pull your arms down and drive your elbows down and back. (Image you’re performing a chinup). The arms overhead will help lengthen your spine, and pulling your shoulders back should help open up your chest and prevent the hunched-over desk syndrome.\nLess Pain When Lying\nThe Correct Position\n\nSide-lying position with shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles stacked directly above opposite side.\nKnees and hips slightly bent\nAnkles, hips, shoulders, and ears are all in-line\nPillow under your head, between your arms, and between your knees to support neutral alignment\n\nCommon Flaws\n\nLying on your face or back, which applies undesired torque on your neck\nLying on your side with one shoulder and/or hip rotated relative to the opposite side.\nLying on your side with your body curled up in a fetal position\nLying on your side with neck under- or over-supported\n\nQuick Fix\nFor a week, try going to sleep on your side with a pillow squeezed between your legs. You’ll train your body to sleep in the correct position, and by improving your sleep quality the new position should become second nature.\nThe Posture Mindset\nIt’s important to note that while some postures are more desirable than others, the best posture is a changing posture.\nIn other words, you don’t want to be stuck in the same position for hours on end. That means you should stand up and move a little at least once every hour.\nYour body naturally adapts to the positions it spends the most time in. Regularly breaking these cycles with movement and stretching can help ensure you don’t structurally or functionally adapt to a position that is going to limit your performance or set you up for injury.\nAdam BornsteinAdam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and, according to The Huffington Post, “one of the most inspiring sources in all of health and fitness.” An award-winning writer and editor, Bornstein was the Fitness and Nutrition editor for Men’s Health, Editorial Director at LIVESTRONG.com, and a columnist for SHAPE, Men’s Fitness, and Muscle & Fitness.
