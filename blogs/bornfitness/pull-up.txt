"The pull-up might be the best indicator of upper body strength. \nYour arms and back have to do an enormous amount of work to lift your entire body, which is why being able to perform many reps is an effective way to improve not just the obvious muscles — your back, arms and forearms — but can also help you build incredible core strength. \nIn fact, as an exercise physiologist and strength coach, I’d go so far as to say that the pull-up is the world’s most under-appreciated way to develop your abs—and every other muscle in your midsection, for that matter.\nAll of that is great, but there’s one problem: It’s an exercise that gives a lot of people a lot of trouble, regardless of whether you’ve been training for years or just started.\nIf you are struggling to perform a pull-up — or you wish you could do many more — I’ll share a few simple-to-learn techniques that aren’t taught enough and will change everything about your pull-up performance. \nBy the time you’re done, you’ll not only be surprised by how quickly you can improve, but also by how many of the methods used to increase your upper body strength aren’t actually pull-ups.\nCan’t Do a Pull-up? Start Here\nIf you can’t do any pull-ups, odds are you’ll blame it on your lack of back strength. To become stronger, you might start doing countless 1-arm rows and other dumbbell or barbell exercises. \nWhile those exercise will make you stronger (and are a part of the solution), they won’t guarantee that you’ll be able to do more pull-ups. That’s because pull-ups aren’t just about your back. \nEven if you have a really strong back, you can struggle with pull-ups if you have a weak core.\n\nCore stiffness, or being able to create tension throughout your torso, is a key part of successfully doing a pull-up. \nYour shoulder blades are connected to your torso. A stiff, stable core gives your arms something strong to pull on. And that can have a massive impact on your ability to lift your body.\nSo if you are struggling with your pull-ups—or can’t do a pull-up at all—train your core with these moves.\n(If you prefer to watch all tips, here’s a video breaking down a lot of the progressions we’ll discuss today. In it, you’ll see my friend and fellow coach Tony Gentilcore demonstrating a lot of the moves discussed here.) \nHollow Body Holds\n\nStart by lying on the floor. Lift your arms overhead (biceps in line with your ears), keeping your elbows straight. \nCross your hands and your ankles. Then press your hands and ankles into each other to create tension, and lift up into the hollow body position. \nLet’s talk about that term “hollow” for a second. You might hear it and think: “belly button to spine.” DON’T DO THAT. \nIn a good hollow position, your abs are securely braced, as if they were about to take a punch. Take a breath in and squeeze. If anything, your abs will move slightly outward. \nStart by holding a hollow body position while pressing your hands into each other and pressing your ankles into each other. This builds some of the body tension related to the position of hanging from a bar. \nHold this position for 5 seconds or 2-3 breaths per rep, maintaining as much head-to-toe tension as you can (more on how to create tension). Take a 5-second break, then repeat for 5-6 reps per set. Over time, you can increase the duration of your holds. If you can maintain tension for a full minute, that’s really good. \nHollow Body Horizontal Pull-ups\n\nNext, you’re going to use a dowel or broomstick. Hold it in both hands as if it were the pull-up bar. \nStart with your arms straight and elbows locked out, as if you were hanging from a pull-up bar. Then, while you hold the hollow position, bend your elbows to pull the bar across your face and toward your chest line, mimicking the pull-up movement. \nThe goal here is to maintain the core strength requirement while including an arm movement that replicates the pull-up—all while trying to breathe. \nHold the hollow body and try to complete 8-10 reps, breathing out as the bar comes to your collarbone.\nHollow Body Leg Raises\n\nAre you a boss at the hollow body work? Great! Then it’s time to take it up another notch. \nYou can create some additional arm stimulus, and increase the challenge to your core, by doing a leg raise. Keep both knees locked out and cross one foot over the other. Pull down on the stick and lift your toes toward it. You may even be able to touch your toes to the bar, depending on your level of strength and control. \nThe big thing to remember here is to maintain tension throughout your lats to help pull your torso up. Squeeze the bar as hard as you can in your hands and think about pulling down on the bar as much as you are pulling up with your legs. This tension in your arms, back and core will help you lift your legs more easily. \nPerform a set of 5-8 reps. \nStability Ball Rollouts\n\nAnother exercise that develops core stiffness is a stability ball rollout. There are two ways you can perform the movement, and both are helpful to your pull-up quest. \nOption #1: Try to keep your abs tensed and press your hips forward, allowing your arms to extend out as you move. Then pull back with your hips.  This version will place more emphasis on your abs and lower back, while taking some of the work off of your shoulders\nOption #2: Do the same thing as you did in option #1, but use your lats to try and pull the ball back with your elbows to return to the starting position. In this version the shoulder angle is changing, which means the muscles that control the shoulders will be under greater load. \nComplete 5-10 reps of either option, or both if you’re a little crazy.\nHow to Build Strength on the Pull-up Bar\nBefore you start pulling, it’s helpful to build your skill hanging from the bar. \nBar Hang\n\nYou might struggle at maintaining a dead hang from the bar due to grip strength. Hanging for 10-30 seconds can be a simple and very effective way to build the grip strength needed to perform pull-ups. \nHanging Shoulder Shrugs\nWhen you can conquer that challenge with ease, your next goal is pulling your shoulders down and tight to your ribs while holding the same hollow body position you used on the ground. \nHold that position for 5 seconds per rep, breathing out forcefully with each contraction. \nHanging Leg Raises\n\nHave the hollow body hang down cold? Good. You can add in some leg raises to really take it up a notch.\nStart with a bent knee leg raise. The key is to not sway. \nIf that’s no problem, try a straight leg raise. Again, you want to avoid rocking back and forth. The movement should be slow and controlled. \nIn all likelihood, you will find at least one of these moves challenging. Because your goal with these is quality, not quantity, you can use “micro sets” to accumulate volume. Try to hit 10 amazingly good reps total. To do that, you might need to perform 5 sets of 2, or 4 sets of 2-to-3, or 3 sets of 3, and so on.\nIf you wanted to get a little crazy, you could try to bring your toes to the bar. Use your arms to help pull-up on your torso to get a more horizontal angle on the movement.\nPull-up Training: Mastering the Movement\nNow let’s “grease the groove” of the movement in a way that will help you develop strength if you’re a beginner, and provide value if you’re more advanced. \nFlexed Arm Hang\n\nThe flexed arm hang is a simple, yet underutilized move that will have all the muscles in your back and arms firing hard.  \nTo perform the move, just grab the bar and jump up. Keeping your chest as close to the bar as possible, hang there as long as you can tolerate. When you start to feel yourself coming down, fight the lowering for 3-5 seconds so you can get some eccentric strength development out of the move. \nTry to maintain 10 to 30 seconds per hold, accumulating up to 30 seconds in a workout.  For eccentric reps, try to keep it to a max of 5 reps of 3-5 second eccentric lowering unless you want to look like a T-Rex for a few days after your workout because you’re too sore to extend your elbows.\nBand Assisted Pull-ups\nOnce you are able to do flexed arm hangs (and the 3-5 second lowering) with skill and control, you should be ready to try the pull-up. \nIf you want to ease yourself into the movement, start by using a band for assistance. \nThe thicker the band, the more assistance it provides. Similarly, placing two feet in the band versus just one gives you more help when you perform the move. \nStart with the thickest band you need in order to execute the move, then work down to smaller, thinner bands over time.\n(More ways to use resistance bands in your workouts here.)\nThe “Pernicious Pull-up Power” Workout Routine\nSo how do you put all of this together into a realistic pull-up training plan you could use on a regular basis? Glad you asked. \nYou want to “train for the movement” frequently. Three to four times a week is ideal. \nNotice I said “train for the movement” and not “train the movement itself.” That’s because not all of your sessions need to include pull-ups. In fact, you’ll only perform actual pull-ups one day per week on this plan. \nHere’s a sample calendar of what this pull-up training plan looks like: \nDAY 1\nHollow Body Holds – 4 sets x 5 reps/set x 5 second hold per rep\nBar Hangs – 4 x sets x 6 reps/set x 5 second hold per rep\nFlexed Arm Hang – accumulate 30 seconds\nDAY 2\nHanging Shoulder Shrugs – 4 sets x 5 reps/set x 5 second hold per rep\nHollow Body Horizontal pull-ups – 4 sets x 8-10 reps/set\nHanging Leg Raises – 10 total reps\nDAY 3\nHollow Body Leg Raises – 4 sets x 5-8 reps of smooth controlled tension\nEccentric pull-ups – 4 x sets of 4-5 reps working on 3-5 second eccentrics\nDAY 4 (Pull-up day!) \n**If you can’t do a pull-up, perform…\nBand Assisted Pull-ups – aim for a max of 3 reps per set\n** If you can do pull-ups, then….\nPull-ups – start with a single max set, then perform 3 sets of 50% of this number. For instance, if you do 6 on the first set, do 3 sets of 3. \nFollowing this pattern will help you develop pull-up specific strength in your back and arms and the core stiffness needed to accomplish the movement. Since there are a max of three moves per session, you can combine this simple calendar with your current training program.\nPull-ups may never be easy. But by training for them specifically, you’ll soon be able to do a lot more than you think.\nREAD MORE: \nThe Fastest Way to Do More Pushups\nThe Tension Weightlifting Technique: How to Make Every Exercise More Effective\nDo Carbs Actually Make You Fat?\nDean Somerset is a kinesiologist, strength coach, author and public speaker who specializes in injury and medical dysfunction management through exercise program design.
