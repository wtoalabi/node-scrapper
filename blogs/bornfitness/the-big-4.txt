"Next-level results depend on the two words everyone hates:\n“It depends.”\n“Should I cut down on carbs? It depends.”\n“Do I need to change my training? It depends.”\n“Will adding supplements make a difference? It depends.”\nThe words sting because it feels like a delay. You want to move fast and transform. But, that’s the first mistake. \n“It depends” isn’t a cop-out. It’s recognition of the hierarchy that will help you finally achieve the success you desire.\nBefore worrying about “it depends” questions, instead, focusing on mastering “The Big 4.” This foundation includes:\n\nDaily movement\nVegetables, fruits, protein each day\nPrioritizing sleep and recovery\nHabituating smiling and sex\n\nOnce you’ve built habits around those behaviors, then hitting the next level depends on your:\n\nGoals\nLifestyle\nSchedule\nBudget\nPreferences\n\nSuccess stands at the intersection of science – personal experience – consistency – and lifestyle factors. \nAt some point, you need to customize.
