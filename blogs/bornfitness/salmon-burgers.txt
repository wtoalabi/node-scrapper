"You love burgers. I love burgers. But sometimes it’s enjoyable to step outside the traditional meat patty and create something that is just as flavorful and enjoyable, but can easily fit into anyone’s diet plan. Enter the salmon burger. High in protein and healthy fats, and when combined with the right flavors, still incredibly delicious. If you like sushi, you’ll enjoy this spin on the traditional salmon burger recipe.\nBorn Fitness Recipes: Salmon Burgers\nFitness goal: Muscle gain, fat loss, general nutrition\nAllergies: soy (from soy sauce), eggs\nPaleo friendly: Yes, unless you decide to add the bun.\nHow to make it vegetarian friendly: If you’re a vegetarian that eats fish, you’re fine.
