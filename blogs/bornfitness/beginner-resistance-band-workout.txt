"The problem with training is rarely the exercises you perform, but, rather, how they are combined together into a program that will challenge and change your body.\nAt some point, rep-after-rep-after-rep just doesn’t do the job, no matter how hard it feels. And, this is especially true for at-home workouts. If you want to make the most of your time training, you need a plan.\nWe’re here to stop the randomness of bodyweight and resistance band plans. The truth is, you can completely transform your body with minimalist equipment, but only if you know how to progress week-over-week and make sure you don’t burn out your body.\nInstead of using barbells or dumbbells, we’re going to maximize the use of resistance bands. This resistance band workout uses a classic workout split (push/pull/lower body or PPL) to create the ultimate 3-day muscle and strength-building split that challenges all the major muscle groups. The plan is simple enough to work for beginners and still has enough progressions (especially if you use bands with more resistance) to challenge more advanced trainees.\nPush/Pull/Legs (PPL) is a 3-day muscle-building and strength-based workout split. Each workout focuses on either pushing, pulling, or your legs.\nYour push workout will target primarily your upper body, specifically the chest, shoulders, and triceps.\nThe pull workout focuses on the backside of your body. It is built around rowing movements that target your back and biceps.\nFinally, the leg workout focuses exclusively on the lower body. You’ll hit your quads, hamstrings, and glutes all in one workout.\nAre you ready? Whether you’re only training at home, want to work out on the road, or just need a joint-friendly new training plan to create a spark, we break down everything you need — including a 4-week plan designed for results. \nWant more workouts?

After all, as we mentioned, this plan can work for a beginner, and it can also challenge those who consistently work out if you add more resistance or use heavier bands.\nTo get the most of our resistance band workouts, you need the band to start above its “resting threshold.” In other words, before you begin any movement, you should feel the resistance in the band. Then, be sure to take your time, feel the burn, and squeeze your muscles during the workout. You want it to have constant tension through the full range of motion.\nHow Do You Get The Right Tension In The Band\nGetting the right tension in your bands comes down to your foot placement. Get it right, and the band will resist your full range of motion. Get it wrong, and the band will be either too tight (and therefore restrict your range of motion) or not tight enough to challenge you.\nHere’s a quick video on where to put your feet in the bands and how to adjust the tension.\n\nHow often should you train?\nAt a minimum, you should perform this workout 3 times per week. Just make sure you follow the Push, Pull, Lower body/Legs cadence. Examples of how to structure your week and when to rest are included below.\nSample workout splits you may consider:\n3 Workouts Per Week\n\nMonday: Leg workout\nTuesday: Off\nWednesday: Push workout (upper body workout)\nThursday: Off\nFriday: Pull workout (upper body workout)\nSaturday/Sunday: Off\n\n3 Days On, 1-Day Off (6 Workouts Per Week)\n\nMonday: Leg workout\nTuesday: Push workout (upper body workout)\nWednesday: Pull workout (upper body workout)\nThursday: Off\nFriday: Leg workout\nSaturday: Push workout (upper body workout)\nSunday: Pull workout (upper body workout)\nMonday: Off\nTuesday: Pick back up again with the leg workout\n\nAs a starting point, perform 3 sets for the exercises we outline below. You can adjust the number of sets based on your weight training experience, or increase the sets once it feels easy. If you’re short on time, just run through all of the exercises once and the workout will take about 20 minutes.\nYour 4-Week Resistance Band Workout\nIf you want to start challenging your body with a planned workout, try our 4-week resistance band workout.
