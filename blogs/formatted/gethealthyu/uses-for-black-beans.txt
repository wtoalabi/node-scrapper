"If you’re looking to include additional sources of protein and fiber in your diet (which we all should be!), black beans are one of the best foods you can eat. Per 1 cup serving, black beans provide 15 grams of protein and 15 grams of fiber. And not only that but they also contain copper, iron, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, manganese, and zinc all of which help maintain strong bones, lower blood cholesterol, aid in digestion, ward off disease (including reducing your risk of cancer!) and help with weight loss. Plus, they’re super inexpensive making them one of the few foods that falls into what we like to call the “golden tri-fecta” meaning they are healthy, inexpensive and they taste good. So whether you buy a can of black beans every time you go to store or purchase them in bulk from Costco, here are 8 awesome uses for the can of black beans in your pantry.
  Nachos
  Nachos may be an obvious place to toss on some black beans and for good reason! They pair perfectly with other Mexican flavors such as jalapeños, salsa and cheese by they also go great with some more non-conventional style nachos such as the ones below with sweet potatoes and red peppers.

  Dips
  We love adding black beans to all sorts of dips including salsas and hummus! They are an easy fiber-filled addition to a cowboy-caviar style salsa or can be mashed just like garbanzo beans in hummus for a unique spin.

  If you think beans are just for lunch and dinner, you’re missing out on a whole world of breakfast options. They’re perfect thrown into burritos, atop huevos rancheros or mixed into your breakfast bowl.

  Soup
  Soup is another place where black beans are an easy addition. They make perfect sense in chili but can really be tossed into whatever bowl of goodness you’d like such as minestrone or vegetable soup.

  Baked Goods
  We know it sounds crazy, but you can actually use black beans in your baked goods too! You can substitute black beans for flour in chocolate brownies for the richest, most chocolaty brownies you’ve ever had (and it doesn’t taste like beans!) – and in the below recipe, adding avocado makes them extra creamy! Don’t judge ‘til you try 😉

  Burger Substitute
  Now that you know black beans are awesome in baked goods, substituting them for meat doesn’t seem that crazy right?! Black beans make for a great alternative to beef burgers and deliver way less fat and way more good-for-you nutrients.
