"Practicing self-care by feeding your body nutritious meals and getting in a full-body workout can help boost your mood, improve your sleep, and help ward off injury, illness, and disease. So many women worry that 30 minutes a day isn’t enough, and that’s just not the case. A half-hour workout is more than enough to get your heart rate up so you can burn calories – and most importantly, feel those mood-boosting endorphins.
  A full-body workout is a perfect way to target both the upper and lower body in one efficient session. But is it ok to do a full-body workout every day? We recommend you give your muscles some downtime, so in between each full-body workout day, do a workout that doesn’t further expend those muscles you worked the previous day. Maybe you focus on a walk or a restorative yoga session. The important part is to move every day, but also take care of your muscles and don’t overtrain them.
  Here’s a full body workout you can do at home, on your own time. Do it first thing in the morning before anything else gets in the way, on your lunch break, when you get home from work, you choose!

  Dive Bomber Push-Ups
