"A simple flight of stairs can provide an intense cardio challenge as well as a great way to sculpt and tone your total body—and this workout is going to do just that. You’ll burn calories, get your heart pumping, and build stronger muscles. In the end, you’ll be sweaty, stronger, and thanking the stairs for a free but fierce workout!
  Using Stairs For Cardio HIIT Training
  Why are stairs such a great cardio tool? Moving up a flight of stairs forces you to work harder against gravity so you push your heart rate to its max and create opportunities for a great HIIT (high intensity interval training) workout. Jogging up a flight of stairs will warm you up and start the body’s fat burning process. And sprinting up or running every other step will turn your moderate intensity into a high-intensity interval. Studies have shown High Intensity Interval Training helps you burn calories at a higher rate and for a longer period of time after you finish.
  Using Stairs To Tone Your Muscles
  The gravity you fight going up stairs also helps you tone your muscles. Obviously, your thighs, butt, and calves will benefit simply by running the stairs. But the variety of moves in this workout will also help you build strength all over with quick toning moves to firm up your arms, back, chest and core. So find a set of stairs nearby—indoors or outdoors works fine—and get ready to shape up all over!
