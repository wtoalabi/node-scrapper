"Push-ups. They’ve been around as long as the term “fitness” and whether you love them or loathe them, they’re here to stay. Why? Because they work! Push-ups may well be the best exercise a woman can ever learn to do because we are often prone to having weak upper body strength. If you can’t do many push-ups now, that’s fine! That’s why we’re excited to dive into this 28-Day Push-Ups Challenge for Beginners!
  The benefits of push-ups
  Before you start this push-up challenge, let’s level set with some key information. Push-ups not only strengthen your chest, but also your shoulders, biceps, triceps, back, and glutes while toning and tightening your entire core and burning calories. During a push-up movement, the muscles are activated to stabilize the body also helping lower down and push you out of the floor.
  On top of that, they build your confidence and boost your appearance. And of course, the bonus is that they can be done anywhere, any time, with no equipment required.
  How do I do a regular push-up?
  For push-ups, you must maintain the correct form the entire time you lower your body and push back up. In the push-up position, make sure your back and core align.
  Your body should run a straight line from your back to your feet. If your butt sticks up, you need to realign. Keep your body straight.
  If you follow these recommendations your push-up technique will be safe and effective.
  
  
  
  How many push-ups should a beginner do?
  Depending on the source you read, an adult woman should be able to do anywhere from 10 to 15 standard push-ups—that’s a full push-up on your toes—without stopping! So how do you get there? Allow yourself to be a beginner!
  Beginners should only complete as many pushups on any given day as they can while maintaining proper form. In many cases, this is the first step with a single push. For some, it might mean from 5-10 push-ups.
