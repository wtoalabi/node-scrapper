"Nothing is more frustrating than trying to do something with your body when your body doesn’t cooperate. Perhaps you used to run marathons and now it hurts to finish a 5k. Or maybe plyometrics and jumping used to be a staple in your workout life and now you wouldn’t dream of it. The fact is that our bodies change over time. Injury, overuse, chronic pain— there are so many reasons to choose low-impact activities. In fact, even if you don’t have a specific physical reason you NEED to choose low impact, it’s still a good idea to put it in the mix for good preventative care. All the impact eventually adds up, so mixing up your workouts is a smart idea. For those of you who still want that killer workout, here’s the good news: low impact does NOT mean low intensity. You can choose low-impact exercise and still put forth a maximal work effort to get great results. In fact, we’ve created this low-impact workout just for you with some of the best exercises to do at home!
  
  What Is Low-Impact?
  Simply stated, low-impact exercise is when at least one foot stays in contact with the ground—meaning no jumping or plyometric work. Walking, hiking, rollerblading, step aerobics and cardio-dance formats can all be low-impact exercise. Some formats are not only “low-impact” but count as “no-impact.” These include things like swimming, water aerobics, cycling and elliptical machines.
  Why Choose Low-Impact?
  Common reasons for choosing low-impact exercise include pregnancy, obesity, aging, or joint and pain or injuries. But the truth is low-impact exercise is beneficial for EVERYONE—even the healthy, pain-free person. High impact puts stress on your joints and bones and low impact options will reduce the risk of injuries.

  What Are My Low-Impact Options?
  Low-impact workouts are everywhere! Some of the most common options around include:
  
  Walking: Always available and super simple. Lace up, head out, and get your walk on. Remember you can increase intensity by walking up hills, power walking fast, or carrying weights.
  Elliptical: The ever popular elliptical machine doesn’t have to be monotonous. Change it up by adding intervals which adds intensity and heart rate for more results.
  Dance Formats (like Zumba): This one will get your body, mind and soul going! Between the music and the movement these classes are too fun to feel like a workout. Only your sweat will give it away.
  Cycling: Indoor or outdoor, cycling is an amazing low-impact workout! Ride outside and enjoy the view or check our Beginner’s Guide to Spin Class and take an indoor class to pack an extra punch in your routine. Bring an extra towel!
  Stairmaster: Hitting the stairs is a great workout, but it can take a toll on the joints. The stairmaster gives you all of the climbing without all of the pounding. Bonus: This is stellar way to shape your backside!
  Rowing or Kayaking: What the stairmaster does for your booty, rowing or kayaking will do for your upper body. While still using power from the legs and core, this gets your heart rate up, burns a ton of calories and also focuses on the arms, back and shoulders. And by the way- your core will thank you too! Keep in mind if that getting a kayak into the water isn’t possible, indoor rowing is more popular than ever. It’s even showing up as a group training class!
  Yoga: No, you won’t get the heart pumping as much as an outdoor run, but you will work and your body deserves a little stretch, some time to breathe, and a bit of rejuvination. Yoga comes in many forms from long deep stretches of Yin, to the heart-pumping flow of vinyasa. Discover which one is right for you and get your yoga on!
  Strength Training: One thing’s for sure, cardiovascular exercise isn’t enough. Strength training is a necessary part of your overall health and wellness. Take out a few cardio days and insert some strength training into your routine. The list of benefits is long and it another great way to avoid impact while you are exercising.
  
  Most of you can find something on that list you like. But since we know cross training is important and eventually you’ll be looking for other options, we’ve created a great low-impact workout for you that’s fast, easy, and portable enough to do anywhere. Grab a light set of dumbbells and let’s get started.
  This workout is done circuit-style. You will perform each move for 1 minute, and then go directly to the next one. Once you finish the entire sequence of 8, go back to the beginning and start again. Some moves use hand weights and some are bodyweight-only Remember, low-impact does not have to be low intensity, but it all depends on the effort you put in. Use a big range of motion and, using good form, move swiftly enough to raise your heart rate so that you are breathing through your mouth. Here some of the best exercises to do at home:
