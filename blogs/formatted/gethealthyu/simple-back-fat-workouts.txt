"Back fat, bra bulge…whatever you call it, it can be bothersome. And reducing back fat takes consistent strength training and focus. If there is one thing I will tell you, it’s that you need to clean up your diet and start a regular routine of working your back and core muscles. 
  Here are two quick workouts focused on fighting back fat. Perform these quick workouts first thing in the morning, on your lunch break, on-the-go, or as an addition to another workout. The first one is bodyweight-only, and the second just requires a set of dumbbells. Try adding one or both of them into your routine a few times a week to start seeing results.   
  Bye-Bye Back Fat Workout
  
  This one is just four moves! Do 15 reps of each when you need a quicker workout to tone your back and get rid of back fat for good. This workout will take you 10 minutes or less.
  1. Renegade Rows: 15 Reps/side
  
  How to perform:
  
  Begin in a full plank, arms extended, and on toes (kneeling variation is fine if you are not able to do a full plank). Engage your abdominals drawing the belly inward towards your spine.
  Pull right arm up toward the side of your abdominals. Slowly return it to the floor and repeat with the left arm.
  
  2. Side Plank Scoops: 15 Reps/side
  
  How to perform:
  1) Begin in a full side plank position with right hand below shoulder, left arm reaching high above left shoulder and legs long. (Modify by placing bottom knee onto mat if needed)
  2) Tighten abdominals and slowly scoop left arm under the body, following with your eyes until you see behind you.
  3) Slowly reach left hand back to start position.
  3. Swimming: 15 seconds
  
  How to perform:
  1) Lie on your stomach with the legs and arms extended. Engage your abdominals so you feel your transverse abdominis contract.
  2) Lift your arms and legs off the floor and keep your nose in a hover above the mat.  Flutter your arms and legs, moving from the hips and shoulders (not the knees and elbows) like you’re swimming.
  4. Breast Stroke: 15 Reps
  How to perform: 
   1) Start lying face down on mat. Engage your abs and extend arms overhead. The head is lifted in a low hover. Your body is one long line.
  2) Using your back muscles and core, sweep the arms around and down to your sides like you are doing the swimming stroke, breast stroke.  Lift the chest away from the mat into extension as you exhale. Think of lengthening from the crown of the head.
  3) Return back down to the mat slowly and return your arms overhead. 
  Back Fat Blast Workout
  
  This workout is three moves and requires a set of dumbbells. Use heavy enough weights that you feel fatigued and are working “comfortably hard.” Repeat the whole series twice through for a quick 10 minutes or less workout.
  1. Renegade rows: 10 Reps/side
  
  How to perform:
  
  Begin in a full plank, arms extended, and on toes (kneeling variation is fine if you are not able to do a full plank). Engage your abdominals drawing the belly inward towards your spine.
  Pull right arm up toward the side of your abdominals. Slowly return it to the floor and repeat with the left arm.
  
  2. Reverse grip rows: 15 Reps
  
  How to perform:
  1) Start with legs together and sit back into a slight squat engaging abdominals. Arms are in front of the body holding dumbbells at hip height with palms facing the ceiling.
  2) Draw elbows back past hips gently hugging the side body so you feel lats and triceps engage and return forward with control.
  3. Overhead pulls: 15 Reps
  
  How to perform: 
  1) Lie on back with knees bent and feet on the floor. Arms are extended above chest to start. Engage your abdominals.
  2) Lower dumbbells past your head keeping arms mostly straight with elbows slightly bent. Keeping abdominals tight raise dumbbells back to start. Low back should stay firm against the floor throughout.
  Remember, like with all strength training, getting rid of stubborn back fat takes consistency. There is no quick fix when it comes to reducing body fat, but the good news is: if you put your mind to it, do the back fat exercises and eat clean, you’ll notice a smoother look in your t-shirts and tanks!
