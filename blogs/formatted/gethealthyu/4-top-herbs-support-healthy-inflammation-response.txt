"Inflammation is defined as “a localized reaction that produces redness, warmth, swelling and pain as a result of infection, irritation or injury to cells or tissue.” Not so pleasant, right? But the truth is, our bodies need healthy inflammation to heal—it’s actually a natural response in the body.
  Even your everyday exercise routine can cause the body to emit an inflammatory response—many people notice this as minor discomfort or soreness after a workout. It can happen after a long run; my knee has been known to act up if I put in too many miles.
  
  So how do you soothe that occasional pain and help your body have a healthy inflammation response? Herbs! Did you know that incorporating certain herbs into your diet can support a healthy response to inflammation in the body?
