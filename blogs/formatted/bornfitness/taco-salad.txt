"Never underestimate the importance of having a few bomb salad options on hand for easy mid-week meals. I got you covered with this Taco Salad variation.
  Why I love it: Tacoâ€¦enough said.
  Taco Salad Ingredients
  
  Lean ground turkey, cooked and seasoned with taco seasoning
  Greens (romaine, kale, or spring mix), chopped
  Avocado, sliced
  Red Bell Pepper, sliced
  Corn removed from cob
  Black Beans, rinsed and drained
  Salsa
  Plain Greek Yogurt
  
  Taco Salad Directions
  
  Assemble vegetables on top of greens.
  Serve with a spoon full of each salsa and yogurt (this will act as your dressing).
  
  Need a little extra carbs? Add 1-2 corn tortillas to wrap all this goodness up. (I recommend the street taco size).
