"Sometimes buying pre-packaged food is not that much quicker than making a healthy snack from scratch. This one-step tomato basil hummus is made in about as much time as it takes to open the can of chickpeas. Plus, it’s homemade with fresh ingredients, contains no preservatives, and is full of flavor.
  You can use it as a dip or be creative. Spread the tomato basil hummus on an Ezekiel wrap, add grilled chicken slices and arugula for a quick lunch or use it as a marinade on white fish, wrap it up in aluminum foil and bake until cooked thoroughly.
