"Jicama (Hi-ku-mah) – root vegetable that is juicy and crunchy, with a slightly sweet and nutty flavor. Tastes like a cross between a potato and a pear… And it’s an excellent source of fiber and vitamin C!
  Why I love it: Jicama is super versatile and found at most grocery stores. Can be eaten raw as a snack, in salads, or cooked in stir fry. This jicama slaw has the fresh taste of summer with cilantro and a crisp mix of veggies.
