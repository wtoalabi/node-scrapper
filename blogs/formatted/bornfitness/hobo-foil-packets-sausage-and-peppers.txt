  What Is A Hobo Foil Packet?
  A hobo foil packet is a quick, simple meal solution popular among campers. It’s a bundle of cut-up ingredients that are packed into some foil and thrown on top of the campfire. Don’t have a campfire? No sweat. Let your kids make their own foil pack and pop ’em in your oven for a fun and super simple family night meal.
