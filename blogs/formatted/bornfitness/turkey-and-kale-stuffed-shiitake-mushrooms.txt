"These Turkey and Kale Stuffed Shiitake Mushrooms are packed with flavor, high in protein, and half the work of your typical stuffed mushrooms.
  Ingredients
  
  Shiitake mushrooms, cleaned and stems removed (any size, but medium/large caps work best)
  1 lb lean ground turkey
  1/2 cup sweet onion, diced
  1/2 cup Celery, diced
  1 clove garlic, minced
  1/2 cup shiitake mushrooms (additional from caps)
  1 cup Kale, finely chopped
  2 tablespoons Worcestershire
  Oil and cayenne
  2 tablespoons freshly grated Asiago cheese
  
  Directions
  
  In a skillet on medium heat saut√©e onions, celery, garlic, and diced shiitakes for 3 minutes.
  Add turkey. Cook until almost all the pink color is gone.
  Add kale and 2 tablespoons Worcestershire. Allow kale to wilt.
  Place shiitake caps on a lined baking sheet. Lightly coat with oil. Dust both sides with Cayenne pepper.
  Spoon turkey/kale mixture onto prepared mushroom caps.
  Place caps in preheated oven (350 degrees). Cook for 6 minutes.
  Add cheese. Cook for 5-6 more minutes.
  Serve warm.
  
  Note: I used 8 medium/large caps and had extra turkey mixture for leftovers. Use only enough cheese to taste to keep it low calorie.
