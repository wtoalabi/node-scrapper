"In 
   his first TNT article, big Dave Tate 
   cut through the BS and dropped some great training info on us. This week Dave 
   provides us with a few more explosive tips and tricks, this time for the more 
   advanced trainee. 
   Keep in mind that this article is geared toward those who are already familiar 
   with the Westside system of training. If you’re not, then you may want 
   to check out these articles by Dave: Squatting from Head to Toe, Accommodating Resistance, Drag Your Butt into Shape, and The Periodization Bible, Part II.
  
   “What is work capacity and how can I increase it?”
  During 
   a recent dinner conversation with Louie Simmons and Mel Siff (author of Supertraining), 
   the topic of periodization training came up. Mel made a statement that I’ll 
   never forget. He told us about something Medvedyev, one of the originators of 
   the periodization concept, had said years before: “Periodization training in 
   the United States has been set back 40 years by some of the current books written 
   on the topic.”
  This 
   is a statement Louie and I have been trying to tell athletes for years. Not 
   only will this Western style of training lead to overtraining and stagnation, 
   it also ignores one basic concept of training: increasing work capacity.
  Work 
   capacity is the underlying component of any training program. It’s the 
   ability to perform work, which determines your level of fitness that will, in 
   turn, determine your level of preparedness. If you raise your work capacity 
   too fast, you’ll overtrain; if you reduce it under your current level, 
   you’ll regress. If your work capacity is still at the same level it was 
   two years ago, then I’ll bet you’re at the same strength and hypertrophy 
   level you were two years ago! 
  So 
   how the heck do you increase work capacity? You can increase your work capacity 
   by several means; one of the best ways is to incorporate extra training sessions. 
   In other countries, it’s not uncommon to see athletes performing up to 
   three or four workouts per day! There are several types of extra workouts that 
   can make a tremendous difference in your training. Each type of workout is designed 
   to illicit a certain outcome. Here are some examples: 
  1) 
   Recovery Workouts: These training sessions may also be known as “feeder” 
   workouts and are designed to aid in the recovery process. For example, if you 
   performed a heavy bench press workout on day one with 400 pounds, then on day 
   two you’d use the same exercise with very light weight for higher repetitions, 
   such as 135 for two sets of 20. The idea is to induce blood into the muscle 
   to speed the recovery process. 
  Another 
   type of feeder or recovery workout (and the one most used at Westside Barbell) 
   is sled dragging. This has helped our lifters with a multitude of training situations. 
   We’ve seen the use of the sled add 30 to 60 pounds to the deadlift, aid 
   in the recovery process, add lean body mass, and bring up weak points. 
  The 
   sled can be used for a number of different exercises for both the upper and 
   lower body. Some of these include standard around-the-waist dragging, ankle 
   dragging (where you drag the sled with the use of your legs), and pull-through 
   dragging (where you drag the sled by holding the sled strap between your legs). 
   You can also perform upper body dragging where you drag the sled by performing 
   front raises, rear raises, side raises, presses and extensions. 
  <img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/169drag.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\"/>
  These 
   sled exercises are best used with the empirical rule of 60%. This basically 
   means that on day one you choose the heaviest weight you’ll use for that 
   exercise and then decrease the weight by 60% each day after that for three days. 
   After that point you repeat the process. This rule is essential for avoiding 
   stagnation with any given dragging exercise. 
  A 
   great benefit of the sled is that there’s no eccentric (negative) motion 
   for many of the exercises. It’s believed that the eccentric is responsible 
   for DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) and when the eccentric is taken away 
   from the exercise, you’re left with a concentric motion that’ll induce 
   blood flow to the muscle without causing soreness. 
  2) 
   Work Capacity Workouts: The sled is also used for increasing work 
   capacity by dragging heavy twice a week. In this case, the athlete would start 
   with one 45-pound plate on the sled and drag it for 200 feet, then rest for 
   30 to 45 seconds, put another plate on the sled and drag it for another 200 
   feet. This is repeated until the weight can’t be pulled the desired distance. 
   This exercise alone has been responsible for bodyweight gains up to 30 pounds 
   with several members of Westside, as well as many of my personal clients.
  3) 
   Targeting Weak Points: These workouts are extra training sessions 
   devoted to your weak points. For most athletes, the abdominals are a great example 
   of where extra training sessions can make a real difference. This workout would 
   be preformed separate from the main training workout and would specialize on 
   that one area.
  A 
   sample-training week using these extra workouts may look like this:
  Monday 
   (8:30 am) = Max Effort Training for the squat and deadlift
  Monday 
   (4:00pm) = Extra work on the reverse hyper, glute ham raise and abdominals
  Monday 
   (5:00pm) = Recovery sled work
  Tuesday 
   (8:30 am) = Recovery sled work, feeder work on the reverse hyper and 
   extra abdominal work
  Wednesday 
   (8:30 am) = Max Effort Training for the bench press 
  Wednesday 
   (4:00pm) = Extra work on the reverse hyper, glute ham raise and abdominals
  Wednesday 
   (5:00pm) = Recovery sled work
  Thursday 
   (8:30am) = Recovery sled work, feeder work for the chest and triceps 
   and extra abdominal work
  Friday 
   (8:30am) = Dynamic Effort Training for the box squat
  Friday 
   (4:00pm) = Extra work on the reverse hyper, glute ham raise and abdominals
  Friday 
   (5:00pm) = Recovery sled work
  Saturday 
   (8:30am) = Recovery sled work, feeder work on the reverse hyper and 
   extra abdominal work
  Sunday 
   (8:30am) = Dynamic Effort Training for the bench press
  This 
   type of training takes years to build up to, of course, but I wanted to show 
   you that increasing your work capacity is needed to reach the next level. For 
   most guys wanting to train with the Westside system, the four main training 
   days will be plenty. 
  
   “Do you ever lose your squat groove when doing only box 
   squats in training?” 
  We 
   do have some lifters who look terrible on the box, yet go to a meet and look 
   great, but the benefits of the box squat are numerous. Box squats develop eccentric 
   and concentric power by breaking the eccentric-concentric chain and by going 
   from a static position to a dynamic one.
  The 
   box squat is the best way to teach proper form on the squat because it’s 
   easy to sit back while pushing your knees out. Most lifters have a difficult 
   time sitting back far enough to isolate the hamstrings and glutes during the 
   squat motion. The reason for this is simple — weak hams and glutes. Most 
   athletes have been taught to squat using mostly their quads. In our opinion, 
   this is wrong because the strength potential of the hips and hamstrings outweigh 
   the potential of the quads. 
  Before 
   I moved to Columbus to train with Louie, I was also a quad squatter and had 
   worked my way up to a 760-pound squat. I was happy with this but was also stuck 
   between 730 and 760 for five years. I knew I needed a change. The first 
   thing I was told to do was move my stance out and sit back farther by pushing 
   my hips out first, then bending my knees. This change over the next six months 
   reduced my squat by 30 pounds. My problem was that my hips and hamstrings 
   were so far behind my quads that it was going to take longer than I’d expected, 
   but over the next five years my squat jumped to 935.
  Here’s 
   how to perform box squats: 
  To 
   take the bar out of the rack, the hands must be evenly placed on the bar. Secure 
   the bar on the back where it feels the most comfortable. To lift the bar out 
   of the rack, one must push evenly with the legs, arch the back, push your abs 
   out against the belt, and lift the chest up while driving the head back. A high 
   chest will ensure the bar rests as far back as possible. Slide one foot back, 
   then the other, to assume a position to squat. Set your feet up in a wide stance 
   and point your toes straight ahead or slightly outward. Also, keep your elbows 
   pulled under the bar to ensure tightness in the upper back.
  When 
   you’re ready for the decent, make sure to keep the same arched back position. 
   Pull your shoulder blades together and pull as much air into your stomach as 
   possible. Again, push your abs out. You’ll maintain this tightness throughout 
   the set. To begin the descent, push your hips back and push your knees 
   out to the sides to ensure maximum hip involvement. Once you reach the 
   box, you need to sit on it and release the hip flexors while keeping the back 
   arched and abs pushed out. At the same time, drive your knees out to the side.
  To 
   begin the ascent, keep pushing out on the belt, arch the back as much as possible, 
   and drive the head, chest, and shoulders to the rear. If you push with the legs 
   first your buttocks will raise first, forcing the bar over the knees and causing 
   stress to the lower back and knees, thus diminishing the power of the squat. 
   You need to keep the barbell in a direct line with the heels throughout the 
   entire movement and this can only be done by keeping your back arched. 
  <img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/169dave.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"/>
  As 
   a final note, many lifters freak out when the box is taken away. Because of 
   this, they go back to sitting straight down instead of sitting back. Don’t 
   let this happen to you; make sure to squat how you’ve been trained to squat 
   and you won’t have this problem. If you squat 10,000 times on a box at 
   the same height with the same form, then squatting without the box is automatic. 
   The movement becomes instinctive and our lifters have no problem hitting slightly 
   below parallel in a meet. 
  At 
   Westside, the only type of squat we ever perform is the box squat. We never 
   perform a free squat until the competition. By using the box squat with many 
   other special exercises, we’ve created two 1000-pound squatters, eight 
   900-pound squatters and twenty-three 800-pound squatters. We don’t have 
   records for any squats lower than that because almost anybody can squat 700 
   pounds, including you!
  
   “How should I train my box squats?”
  I’ve 
   been getting tons of questions about the various types of squat cycles. Rather 
   than just writing one cycle, I’ve decided to make an easy to follow quasi-article 
   that contains all the different cycles for the squat that I’ve used with 
   success. The first cycles will be for the Dynamic Effort squat without chains 
   and bands; the second group will be with chains, and the last group will be 
   with bands. We’ve found that training with bands is the most effective 
   way to train the squat. I’d recommend that everyone use bands all year 
   round in some form or another. 
  A 
   note about the percentages: These are taken off a contest squat with 
   equipment. So if you’re lifting off a raw or no-equipment max, then add 
   5 to 10% to all the percentages listed.
  
   Squat without chains and bands
  Years 
   ago, I’d have recommended a four week squat wave, but after the success 
   we’ve had with band training I feel a three week wave would be the most 
   efficient. I also believe there needs to be slightly different percentages based 
   on the motor control of the athlete. This control is based on years of training, 
   not the status of the athlete. For example, a beginner would have one to three 
   years of training, the intermediate three to five years, and the advanced lifter 
   over five years. The reason for this is quite simple: the more advanced athlete 
   knows how to use his body more efficiently than the beginner and gets more out 
   of a smaller percentage.
  Beginner:
  Week 1: 63% for 10 sets of 2 reps
   Week 2: 65% for 10 sets of 2 reps
   Week 3: 68% for 10 sets of 2 reps
  You’ll 
   notice the beginner has a couple more sets than the advanced and intermediate 
   lifter. This is to improve the form of the lifter. The main goal of the beginner 
   is to have perfect form, so in many cases ten sets still won’t be enough 
   and should be taken as high as twelve sets.
  Intermediate:
  Week 1: 60% for 8 sets of 2 reps
   Week 2: 63% for 8 sets of 2 reps
   Week 3: 65% for 8 sets of 2 reps
  Advanced:
   Week 1: 55% for 8 sets of 2 reps
   Week 2: 58% for 8 sets of 2 reps
   Week 3: 60% for 8 sets of 2 reps
  
   Squatting with Chains
  Beginner:
   Week 1: 63% for 10 sets of 2 reps
   Week 2: 65% for 10 sets of 2 reps
   Week 3: 68% for 10 sets of 2 reps
  Four 
   to six reps over the three weeks must be above training percent. This 
   is done in addition to the regular sets.
  Intermediate:
   Week 1: 60% for 8 sets of 2 reps
   Week 2: 63% for 8 sets of 2 reps
   Week 3: 65% for 8 sets of 2 reps
  Four 
   to six reps over the three weeks must be above training percent. This is done 
   in addition to the regular sets.
  Advanced:
   Week 1: 55% for 8 sets of 2 reps
   Week 2: 58% for 8 sets of 2 reps
   Week 3: 60% for 8 sets of 2 reps
  Four 
   to six reps over the three weeks must be above training percent. This is done 
   in addition to the regular sets.
  
   Recommended Chains for Squatting
   Squat Max 200-400 Pounds = 60 pound chain
   Squat Max 400-500 Pounds = 80 pound chain
   Squat Max 500-600 Pounds = 100 pound chain
   Squat Max 700-800 Pounds = 120 pound chain
   Squat Max 800-900 Pounds = 160 pound chain
  The 
   chains are added on to the weight of the barbell. Make sure to warm up with 
   the chains on the bar first, then add the weights. When the barbell is in the 
   rack, four to five links of chain should be resting on the floor. At no point 
   in time should all of the chain be off the floor during the squat. 
  
    Squat Cycles with Bands
  These 
   cycles are only for the intermediate and advanced lifters. The beginners would 
   be better off sticking with straight weight or chains. If the beginner would 
   like to use bands with his squat, then I’d suggest keeping the tension 
   minimal and reducing the training loads by 10%
  Regular 
   Training Phase (or Strength Speed):
   Week 1: 47% (RG Band) 8 sets of 2
   Week 2: 51% (RG Band) 8 sets of 2
   Week 3: 53% (RG band) 8 sets of 2
  Four 
   to six reps over the three weeks must be above training percent. This is done 
   in addition to the regular sets. 
  This 
   phase should be the core of your training and can be “waved” one after another. 
   For better results, it would be best to mix in one of the Speed Strength phases 
   after every couple of regular phases.
  Speed 
   Strength Phase A:
   Week 1: 15% (SS Band) 5 sets of 2
   Week 2: 20% (SS Band) 5 sets of 2
   Week 3: 25% (SS band) 5 sets of 2
  Three 
   to five reps over the three weeks must be above training percent. 
  This 
   is a great phase for those who’ve never been through a speed strength phase 
   before. It lasts three weeks, with the first one being an introduction week 
   to get used to the higher band tension. You’ll also notice the number of 
   sets has been reduced because of the high physical demand on the body. After 
   one or two times through this phase, you’ll never need to use it again 
   because of the body’s adaptation process. Once the body has learned to 
   adapt to the band tension with the three-week phase, it’s best to stick 
   with phase B or C. 
  Remember, 
   a speed strength phase will cause the barbell to move very slowly, so you must 
   always follow a slow phase with a fast phase. As a final note, make sure the 
   bands are very tight in the bottom position.
  Speed 
   Strength Phase B:
   Week 1: 20% (SS Band) 5 sets of 2
   Week 2: 25% (SS Band) 3-5 sets of 2, after sets work up 
   to 1RM
  This 
   is the same phase as “A” except we’ve taken out the first week. The other 
   notable difference is in week two. After completing three to five sets you’ll 
   want to start increasing the weight until you get to a one rep max. By the time 
   you get to the last set (your max), you’ll feel like your head is going 
   to pop off. This is how you’ll know you’re doing it right!
  Speed 
   Strength Phase C:
  Week 1: 25% (SS Band, plus more as needed) 2-3 sets of 
   2 then work up to a 1RM
  This 
   phase is designed for those who have a lot of experience with bands. Basically, 
   you want to pile on as much band as you can handle and start working up to 25% 
   for a few sets of two, then head up to a one rep max. This phase is not for 
   the weak at heart!
  Circa-Maximal 
   Phase:
   Week 1: 47% (CM Band) 5 sets of 2
   Week 2: 51% (CM Band) 5 sets of 2
   Week 3: 53% (CM Band) 5 sets of 2
   Week 4: 47% (CM Band) 5 sets of 2
  Three 
   to five reps over the three weeks must be above training percent. 
  This 
   phase is designed for pre-contest or pre-max training. This phase, along with 
   the following de-loading phase, has been responsible for more personal records 
   being crushed by a huge margin than any other training phase I’ve seen, 
   including at least ten 900-pound squats. 
  De-load 
   Phase:
   Week 1: 53% (RG Band) 5 sets of 2
   Week 2: 47% (RG Band) 5 sets of 2
   Week 3: Meet or Test Date
  This 
   de-loading phase is designed to bring the speed back into the training before 
   the max attempt or competition. This phase is a must after the circa-maximal 
   phase. Some have done very well with a two week de-load while others only like 
   to do one week. If your choice is a one week de-load, then drop the first week 
   of the phase.
  Recommended 
   Bands for Squat Training Phases:
  Squat: 
  
   300-500
   RG Band: Pink
   SS Band: Blue
   CM Band: Green
   501-750
   RG Band: Green
   SS Band: Blue Green
   CM Band: Blue Pink
   751-1000
   RG Band: Blue
   SS Band: Blue Green
   CM Band: Blue Green
  Keep 
   in mind, for the bands to work properly, you must have tension at the bottom! 
  After 
   your squat training you should hit the hamstrings, abdominals and reverse hypers, 
   then call it a day. As you remember from the other articles, a max effort day 
   should be performed later in the week to complement the dynamic effort work.
  Now 
   you have all the info needed to reach that 700, 800, or even 900 pound squat. 
   But remember, knowledge isn’t power, but rather the application 
   of knowledge is power. Now get to the gym and apply it!
