"If you want to stop spinning your wheels and finally build some muscle, and I mean a lot of muscle, you need to use two training methods: heavy strength training to build muscle density and hardness, and hypertrophy methods that focus on rep volume and intensity techniques.
  In the first part of this three-phase program, I outlined the exact workouts I use for the Strength phase. Now let’s look at the next 10-day phase: Volume.
  Volume
  To get big, not just strong, you need volume in your training in addition to strength and power exercises. There’s going to be a lot of exercise variety with any high-volume training program, and variety is good! Every time I’ve introduced something new to my training that my body isn’t used to, it’s had a positive effect on muscle growth and strength.
  However, variety doesn’t mean “cram as many goofy exercises into one training program as you can.” You need a strategic plan. You have to apply volume and variety intelligently, in its own phase.
  Here’s how you do it:

  Enjoy this second phase… if you can. The volume is crazy, so expect a skin-tearing pump. You can also expect to be thoroughly exhausted after each workout. And if you find yourself dreading the never-ending nature of these workouts, don’t think things are going to get any easier. The insanity of Phase 3 is yet to come."
