"Want to Know What Real Mom's Have to Say About Pregnancy and Delivery?\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEvery day, pregnant and postpartum moms reach out to me wondering when the right time for them to start with my prenatal membership is.\nToday, I’m talking to Julianna, an editor here at Knocked-Up Fitness®, mom of four and a client who has gone through the prenatal membership on more than one occasion. She and I are sharing our pregnancy and delivery experiences to let mom’s know that it is possible for pregnancy to be amazing and ache-free.\nWe’re both advocates for pregnancy and postpartum health and fitness, and attest to the fact that a little bit of exercise and knowledge can go a long way! Listen in on our conversation below and get some quick, easy tips to improve your health at any stage of motherhood.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSo let’s talk about why now is the best time to start.\nI get a lot of mom’s asking if they should wait until after delivering baby to start healing from pregnancy. The best response I can give is, NO! If you’re cleared for exercise and are having a safe, healthy, normally progressing pregnancy the best thing you can do for your body and baby is to benefit from pregnancy specific exercise now!\nPregnancy is a time of huge physical changes. Between Julianna and myself we have experienced 6 deliveries, and 7 babies. Each very different from the next!\nAs real moms, we’re chatting about issues that other mama’s want to learn about.
