"It was almost 15 years ago when I was stopped by a 70-year-old woman who changed the way I looked at the pelvic floor.\n\n\n\nAt the time, I just had my first born and she was strapped to me while I was out on a walk.\n\n\n\nAll of the sudden, this woman who I didn’t know came up and started chatting with me about how her uterus fell out of her vagina and it had to be sewn shut.\n\n\n\nAs a new mom who had a background in prenatal and postnatal training, that scared the crap out of me…\n\n\n\nWhy wasn’t taught this in school?Could this happen to me?Why don’t women talk about this?What can I do to help?\n\n\n\nIt was one of those moments that you will remember for the rest of your life…\n\n\n\nBecause that’s when the pelvic floor found me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling confused, overwhelmed, and scared, it was then that I knew I had to learn more about the deep core.\n\n\n\n>>It sent me down this personal and professional journey of understanding more about the pelvic floor, fascia, and, more importantly, how everything in the body is intertwined.<<\n\n\n\nYou can’t just look at the pelvic floor on its own.\n\n\n\nSo many times, women get too fixated on the musculature of the pelvic floor.\n\n\n\nBut for optimal deep core function, you have to look at the body as a whole.\n\n\n\nThere is all of this incredible fascia that runs throughout the entire body that makes everything so interconnected.\n\n\n\nMore importantly, at the base of the pelvis is layers of fascia that helps support the organs inside of our bodies.\n\n\n\nWhich is what this 70-year-old woman’s uterus to fall out of her vagina.\n\n\n\nBut you don’t have to be sewn together.\n\n\n\nOur bodies have so much potential to heal and improve the way it functions.\n\n\n\nI’m here to tell you, from one shocked new mom to another, it’s okay that you don’t understand the biomechanics of how the body works.\n\n\n\nThat’s what I am here to teach you.\n\n\n\nSince that conversation, I develop my own training methods and techniques to heal the pelvic floor (and the body!) from the inside out through movement, breathwork, and mindset.\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to live with pain and dysfunction.\n\n\n\n>>It starts with taking a step back and looking at how everything is connected starting at your pelvic floor.<<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you ready to open your eyes to the pelvic floor?
