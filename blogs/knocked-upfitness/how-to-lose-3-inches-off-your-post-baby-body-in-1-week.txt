"Yes, you heard that right! 3 inches is what Shanna lost from her post-baby belly after only 1 week! She has been working hard doing the workouts I put together for her (including my Treadmill Sprints), pilates & doing a 3-day Ritual Cleanse detox. Not a day has gone by she hasn’t gotten a good sweat’n workout in.\nCan you say “WOW”!\nShanna loved the Ritual Cleanse 3-day detox, that is after she got through her 1st day (thus she was feeling the “detox” effect). I love Ritual Cleanse juices! They make me feel great & will you too 🙂 Why I recommend doing a Ritual Cleanse detox: it’s a great way to “Reset” your digestive system & get you off to a healthy start.\nHere is Shanna’s workout plan for the week:\n\nToday: Kick-butt Pilates!\nTuesday: Treadmill Sprints #2 &  Kettlebell, Plank circuit (2 x’s)\nWednesday: Shanna get’s a “rest” day – well deserved, just keep your hand out of that cookie jar, no extra calories burned today 😉\nThursday & Friday: Walking at least 30 minutes (hopefully twice) &  Kettlebell, Plank Circuit (2 x’s)\nSaturday & Sunday: Elliptical 30-45 minutes & Kettlebell, Plank Circuit (2 x’s)\nExtra Exercise: Chasing after her 2 little girls & holding the 3rd , a great arm workout 😉\n\nEvery Monday for the next 11 weeks I’ll be posting an update on Shanna’s progress along with her workout schedule for the week.\n~E\n\n\nTags: After Baby, Cardio, Core, Detox, Erica Ziel, exercise, exercise modifications, Fitness, knocked-up fitness, Legs, lose the baby weight, Pilates, post-baby belly, Postpartum, pre-baby body, products, Real moms, Ritual Cleanse, Weight LossShare:"
