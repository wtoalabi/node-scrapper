It will feel like you’re getting a calf stretch when you go back and exhale to initiate the movement forward.\n\n\n\n>>Your exhale is going to help you connect deeper with your pelvic floor and lower belly to hug your baby.<<\n\n\n\nThe connection you will begin to feel in your deep core is coming underneath your belly and NOT drawing belly to the spine.\n\n\n\nDownward Dog Into Plank\n\n\n\nYou are still going to be hanging out on the chair for this one.\n\n\n\nTrust me ladies, your body is about to feel allllll sorts of goodness in this plank variation because you are going to be actively creating space along your spine.\n\n\n\nGoing back into downward dog, you’re going to soften your knees while lifting your SITZ bones up to the ceiling.\n\n\n\nIt’s important that your shoulders stay wrapped underneath your ribs so your head doesn’t sink into your body.\n\n\n\n>>You do not have permission to look like a turtle during this movement.<<\n\n\n\nMoving into a pike, you’re going to lift your heels, pull up on your quads and round your spine forward into a plank. Then to go back, tuck your chin and use your core to bring your body into a downward dog.\n\n\n\nWhen you are stretching during this movement, it’s important to have a light connection from the base of the pelvic floor all the way to your fingertips.\n\n\n\nThis will make sure that you are not overstretching by creating opposition through the body.\n\n\n\nTo get out of downward dog, walk your feet towards your chair. By doing this you can avoid putting any stress on your belly.\n\n\n\nThere you have it, mama: your step-by-step guide to doing planks during pregnancy that is safe for your bump!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to help you stay moving during your pregnancy as well as give you tips to prepare your body for birth and recovery postpartum, I want to give YOU a freebie: Bump Approved Pregnancy Workout.\n\n\n\nSo mama, grab your workout >>HERE<< to help you begin connecting with your deep core and setting yourself up for success in the delivery room!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe material contained within is provided for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.
