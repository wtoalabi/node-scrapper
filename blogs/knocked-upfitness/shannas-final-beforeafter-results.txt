"Can you say “WOW”\n\n\nI am so proud of how far Shanna has come! Yes maybe it was a bit slow in the beginning but that’s perfectly ok. As mom’s we try to do it all & sometimes we just need to take a deep breathe, slow down & do what’s best for us…taking care of us!\n\n\n“If Momma ain’t happy ain’t nobody happy” ~ & don’t forget it 😉\n\n\nDid Shanna lose the total weight she wanted to from the beginning? No, but eventually she will & what she has accomplished is a complete transformation, burning excess fat & building strong, lean muscle. See my post on Fat vs. Muscle.  Exactly what happened with her is real-life. Trying to take care of yourself, to lose the baby weight (remember she had 3 babies in 3 years), eat healthy & exercise. That in itself is a challenge not including traveling with 3 littles, sick littles, & potty training! But in the end she did it & mostly importantly is continuing to keep her healthy habits that were created.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe point being that slow progress is good progress. The slower (to a point) that you lose the weight the more likely it will stay off for good. No “diet’s” they really don’t work. Think about it, if it took you 3 years to put the weight on it’s not going to come off in 3 months! It also shouldn’t take 3 years. Remember your body is different, but good different, after baby(s).\n \nShanna’s Stats from December to May she lost…\n\n\n\n\t\n\nWeight loss: 20 lbs!!!\n\n\n\t\n\nShoulders: almost 4 inches\n\n\n\t\n\nChest: almost 3 inches\n\n\n\t\n\nWaist (smallest): 3 inches\n\n\n\t\n\nWaist (biggest): 5 inches!!!!!\n\n\n\t\n\nHips: almost 2 inches\n\n\n\t\n\nThighs: 2 inches\n\n\n\t\n\nCalf: almost 3 inches\n\n\n\t\n\nArms: 1 1/2 inches\n\n\n\t\n\nIn total she lost 23 inches!!!\n\n\n\n\t\n\nBODY FAT lost: 3 1/2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook how happy she looks!
