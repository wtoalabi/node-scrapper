"“I’ve got to tell you,” Oprah says, “anything that cuts your butt in half should be your favorite thing too!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat mom out there doesn’t want that! (If you don’t you’ll still love them) I had to share this with you as I had just written my favorite maternity pants and then a girlfriend informed me that one of Oprah’s favorite things on her show last friday was the Lululemon Relaxed Fit Pant. That’s sooo awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the Still Pant I raved about yesterday I own a pair of these, wore them during my 2nd & 3rd pregnancies & love them as well. Unlike the Still Pant they don’t have pockets in the front but the fit in my opinion is very similar. I just read that the newer Relaxed Fit Pants have a hidden pocket in the waist, love that! (mine are old enough they don’t, must mean it’s time to go shopping for a new pair!) If you get a chance to try them on try them both & make the decision for yourself. Either are great pants during pregnancy & after baby since they both have a drawstring in the waist.\n\n\n\n\nWhich ones are your favorite?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]>\t\t\nTags: 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, After Baby, Erica Ziel, Favorites, knocked-up fitness, Legs, lululemon, Maternity, maternity clothes, mom products, My Favorites, oprah, oprahs favorite things, Pilates, pregnancy, pregnancy fitness, products, stages of pregnancy, YogaShare:"
