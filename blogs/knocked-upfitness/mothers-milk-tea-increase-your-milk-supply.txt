"Breastfeeding & in need of some help with your milk supply?\n\n\n\n\nDon’t give up yet…\n\n\n\n\nTry Organic Mother’s Milk Tea by Traditional Medicinals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI drank this almost every day nursing my son. I had a hard time having enough milk for my little growing boy! I really had to work to keep my milk supply up….I ate a lot (healthy of course), drank a lot of water, & drank 3-5 tea bags of Mother’s Milk Tea every day! It really did work! I noticed a difference if I didn’t drink it.\nBy the way it’s ok if you need to supplement with a little formula. Just because you can’t breastfeed 100% of the time doesn’t mean you should stop either.\nEnjoy those times holding & snuggling your  little ones ~ it goes too fast!\n~E\n \nOther Related Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n7 Pregnancy Super Foods\n\n\n\n\t\n\nImportance of DHA During & After Pregnancy! {Video}\n\n\n\n\t\n\nMy Top 10 Simple Tips for Healthy Eating\n\n\n\n\n\n]]>\t\t\nTags: Breastfeeding, Mother's Milk, Postpartum, products, Traditional MedicinalsShare:"
