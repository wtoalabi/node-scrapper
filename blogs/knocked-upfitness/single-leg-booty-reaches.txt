"Single leg booty reaches are a great exercise to do during pregnancy because they help to strengthen the booty, hips and keep pain out of the low back! \n\n\n\nI recommend using a chair for these to help support your body during this movement. Let’s get started!!\n\n\n\nLightly activate your pelvic floor Bring your left leg up and through, keeping your right leg softExtend your left leg back, really reaching through your toesMake sure you are staying activated through your pelvic floor and deep corePulse three timesSwivel your hip around and bring your leg throughRepeat 3-5 times and then switch sides\n\n\n\nI highly recommend incorporating these side leg booty reaches into your daily routine to help keep your body strong during your pregnancy! Keeping your body strong is SO important because it helps to prevent aches + pains, prepare your body for labor + delivery and sets you up for a faster recovery postpartum. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all things pregnancy-related, check out my Knocked-Up Fitness® Membership.
