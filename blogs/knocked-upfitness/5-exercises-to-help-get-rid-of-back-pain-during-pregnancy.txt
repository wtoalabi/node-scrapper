Squats are a must, as long as you do NOT have any pubic or pelvic pain.\n\nStanding in a wide squat position feet and knees slightly turned out feel wrapping around your thighs into your hips/glutes/upper hamstrings. Keeping a majority of your weight in your heels and sticking your butt back while keeping a light deep core connection {you should feel your pelvic floor lightly activated in a squat and a gently lifting of your lower belly}\nInhale to use those muscles to stand up. Do in sets of 10 to 20 reps.\n\n\nArch and Round\nThink “cat-cow and child’s pose combined” This one feels really good on your low back and is great for feeling your deep core muscles activate.\n\nStart in a child pose position reaching your arms out, keeping your knees wide {especially if you are far along in your pregnancy and your belly is in the way}, you will want to sit your hips back but only as far as you can go to avoid rounding your lower back, you want to arch your lower back so you feel\n\n\nForward Rolls.\nForward Rolls allows you to safely stretch your back muscles. Remember to only move through a range of motion that feels good for your body, which may change as your pregnancy progresses. Do in sets of 3 to 6 reps.\n\nKneeling with the ball positioned close, exhale to initiate the movement by tucking your chin to slowly articulate your spine and roll the ball out.\nInhale to hold this position breathing deep into your belly while gently drawing your shoulders away from your ears and allowing your low back to arch into a comfortable position. Be sure to keep your hips over your knees or behind your knees to avoid unneeded stress on your abdominals – this should feel good and not like you are working your abs {if you feel that then shift your hips back over your knees towards your heels}\nExhale to initiate the movement by tucking your hips and gently pressing your hands into the ball; focus on articulating your spine back to starting position. All while continuing to do a gentle kegel and gently “hug your baby”.\n\n\nRelaxed Belly \nTry holding this position for a minute or two minutes, breathing deep into your belly and allowing your body and pelvic floor to relax. {this is a fabulous 3rd-trimester stretch/relaxing exercise}. Find more exercises in my Knocked Up Fitness Guide to Pregnancy.\n\nSit in a kneeling position with knees out wide enough to allow room for her belly.\nRelax the upper body into the ball as she takes slow deep breathes and relaxes her pelvic floor muscles.\n\n\n \nPigeon Stretch\nGreat for opening up those hips, can help in relieving sciatic discomfort and to stretch your belly. Tight hips can increase hip and back pain during pregnancy. Alternate for 3 sets. Place a pillow under your hips if you need more support or is uncomfortable to sit so deep. Remember your stretches should feel good and not painful!\n\nFold one leg under your belly, towards your opposite hips, reaching your back leg straight along the floor – try keeping a slight arch of your lower back to get a better stretch under your glutes rather than sinking in and tucking your hips.\nGently push off the floor with your upper body until you feel a comfortable stretch of your belly.\nHold for 10 to 20 seconds while breathing deep into your belly and ribcage, allowing a nice stretch of your abdominals. Then roll up and switch sides.\n\nNotice a pattern throughout many of these exercises that can help to decrease back pain during pregnancy – you must engage {gently} your deep core muscles to move your body, no matter what the exercise, even if a stretch!\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, back pain, back pain during pregnancy, back pain in pregnancy, back pain pregnancy, back pain relief, Core, deep core, how to prevent low back pain, Kegels, low back pain, low back pain pregnancy, pain during pregnancy, pregnancy, pregnancy back pain relief, stages of pregnancy, symptoms during pregnancyShare:"
