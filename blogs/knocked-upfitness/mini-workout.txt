"This 3 1/2 min. workout is great for anyone, even if your pregnant. Follow either the beginner/prenatal, intermediate/postnatal, or advanced for your custom workout. Repeat as many times as you like. Once you get the exercises down you can go at your own pace and do more reps too!\n\nEnjoy!\nErica\n\nP.S.
