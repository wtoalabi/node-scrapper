"Yes, for most it is absolutely safe to exercise during your pregnancy. However, for some it may not be. Always be sure to check with you doc first.\nA few simple rules to follow:\nIf you are healthy & have been exercising prior to becoming pregnant, you can continue doing what you have been doing.  An important point I must make, be sure to always listen to you body and slow down or discontinue exercise if you start to feel lightheaded, dizzy, nauseous, or start spotting.\nIf you weren’t exercising prior to becoming pregnant it doesn’t mean you can’t, by all means you should, as long as your Doc gives you the green light!. You just need to be more cautious and not try any new exercise that is strenuous. Keep it simple, just get moving. Aim for 30 minutes everyday, include some resistance training.\nRemember you are exercising to feel good, help limit/keep your weight gain within a healthy range, & prepare your body for labor & delivery.\n \nRelated Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\n3 Reasons You Should Be Swimming!\n\nCan I Run While Pregnant?\nSweat Pregnant Mamas, Sweat!\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, exercise, exercise modifications, Is it safe to exercise, is it safe to exercise during pregnancy, pregnancy, Pregnancy Aches, pregnancy complications, pregnancy exercise, Pregnancy Questions, prenatal exercise, safety, stages of pregnancy, symptoms during pregnancy, week-by-week pregnancyShare:"
