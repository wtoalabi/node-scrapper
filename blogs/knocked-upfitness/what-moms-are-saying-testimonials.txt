"Check out what moms and experts are saying about Erica’s training and Knocked-Up Fitness Prenatal and Postnatal Programs!\n“Erica is one of my favorite prenatal (and postnatal!) fitness experts, and I adore her book. It’s clear, straightforward and fun – and it’s comprehensive without being overwhelming. Any mom-to-be who wants to stay fit and have a better labor will love it!”\n~ Anna Maltby, fitness editor, Fit Pregnancy\n\n“We must say it {The Knocked-Up Fitness Guide to Pregnancy} is a must have fitness bible for anyone who is expecting.”\n~ BellyItchBlog.com\n“I have an 8 month old, and I’m just now starting to get back in shape. I had been looking for a video, since I live in Texas and it is way too hot to do anything outside. A lot of the after baby workouts are a lot of cardio, and I really can’t do those right now (nursing). But this DVD is great. There’s no impact, but the constant movement from one position to another still gets your heart rate up. There are several workouts (including options for more advanced users), and an enclosed booklet helps structure which ones you do when. Each workout is no longer than 25 minutes, which is great when you have a baby. There’s also an option to play the video with music only, without the instructor’s commentary. One of the best workout DVD’s I’ve seen. Highly recommended.”\n~ Leila Hayes\n\n“Erica’s unique approach to helping her clients stay motivated is an integration of mind, body and spirit. I look forward to getting Pilates workouts done and cherish that time for me. With a busy life of operating two businesses, raising two beautiful babies fifteen months apart practically as a single mom, the balance I achieve from making a choice to dedicate an hour of my day to my well being is important! Erica shows her clients how to do this even when life gets in the way and I cannot make a class. I have never felt and looked better and at almost 40, I am in the best shape of my life.”\n~ Cat K.\n“It’s really important to me that I stay fit and active during pregnancy…I was glad to discover Knocked-Up Fitness DVDs. They’re challenging enough so that I stay toned but completely safe for expectant moms. I’m using the DVDs a few times a week now to stay in shape for myself—and for my baby.”\n~ Irene Chang Kwon Working Mother Magazine\n\n“I first started working with Erica nine weeks into my first pregnancy and have continued both after my son was born and now during my second pregnancy. I’m in better shape than I’ve ever been and I owe it all to her very practical approach to fitness. Initially, I worked out because I wanted to look good, but I realized it’s much more about feeling healthy! I can think of so many days I just didn’t think I had it in me to work out, and within minutes of Erica’s programs, I felt a million times better and ended up finding the energy I needed to get me through the rest of my day. I now have the strength I need to physically life and carry my son and all of the equipment that goes along with having kids.”\n– Monica J.\n\n“Erica incorporates exercises to strengthen your deep core muscles, which can help you have both a smoother pregnancy and delivery, along with a faster recovery.”\n~ Dr. Gigi Kroll M.D. OB/GYN\n“I’ve always loved small group pilates classes and when I found out I was pregnant, I wanted to keep it up. A friend of mine posted about these videos on facebook, so I thought I would give them a try. I had never done a pilates video before, and they have exceeded my expectations. Some days its just not possible to get to class, and these videos have proven to be just as good. Plus, I love knowing that when the baby comes, and my schedule might leave me more restricted to my home, I can do these to get back in to shape. Whether you’re a pilates snob or a novice, these videos work.”\n~ Monica Paull\n \n\n \n\n“I am not one that works out on a regular basis, so I was looking for something that would challenge me, but also be easy on me because I am pregnant and didn’t exercise regularly before I was pregnant. I got these as a Christmas gift, and LOVE them! Erica is amazing! She talks to you through the work out, and the workouts are just what I was looking for! I feel so good after I do them. If you are looking for a workout for you and you little baby, I recommend these videos!”\n~ Tabatha\n\n \n“I’m a really big fan of Erica’s approach to pre and postnatal fitness – it’s simple, yet her program is packed with useful and relevant tips that are ideal for busy moms and moms-to-be. This is a must-read for any mom who wants to take a proactive approach to staying fit during pregnancy, awaken the muscles used for childbirth, or regain her pre-baby physique.”\n– Dr. Sheryl Ross, M.D., a board certified OB/GYN and founder of D3FY Vitamins\n Private online Skype Training and Consulting sessions with Erica are now available, click here for more info.\n \nOther Related Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\n A New Reason to Keep Up with Those Kegels!\nKnocked-Up Fitness Prenatal + After Baby Workouts + eBook\nFitness Fusion Workout {Video}\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, After Baby, Coaching, Consulting, Erica Ziel, healthy pregnancy, knocked-up fitness, labor, Nutrition, Online Training, postnatal fitness, pregnancy health, pregnant women, prenatal exercise, products, Real moms, Real talk, Testimonials, Training with Erica, week-by-week pregnancyShare:"
