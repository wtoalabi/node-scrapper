"Many pregnant and new moms experience low back and hip pain but you CAN do something to help reduce and possible even get rid of back pain too!  These simple foam rolling to release tension exercises can really help release the tension in your lower back and hips, especially during pregnancy when you feel you may be limited on your range of motion. As always be sure to discuss your workouts with your doctor and if something doesn’t feel good for your body, skip it and move on.\n\n \nIncorporate these foam rolling to release tension exercises in your daily workout routine. It’s best to do after you’re warmed up, ideally after you’ve done one of your prenatal workouts or  postnatal workouts.  Then again if needed at the very end of your workout.\n\n\n \nTags: Erica Ziel, exercise, exercise fitness workout, exercise for pregnant women, exercise modifications, exercising while pregnant, first trimester pregnancy, Fitness, fitness and exercise, fitness while pregnant, foam rolling, health and fitness articles, knocked-up fitness, labor and delivery, Pilates, pregnancy, pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy exercise, pregnancy fitness, pregnancy fitness dvd, pregnancy health, Pregnancy Questions, pregnancy symptoms, pregnancy symptoms and signs, pregnancy tips, pregnancy to birth, pregnancy trimester, pregnancy workouts, pregnant women, prenatal care, prenatal workouts, safe exercises during pregnancy, symptoms during pregnancy, third trimester pregnancy, YogaShare:"
