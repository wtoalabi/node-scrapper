"Congratulations to the Royal family as they welcome their new baby boy into the world today!\nSo in spirit of Duchess Kate having her baby I wanted to put together a workout inspired by her exercise habits during pregnancy. Now of course, who ever knows what’s 100% true, but the word is that she enjoyed her yoga & swimming during pregnancy. Ok so “enjoyed” I don’t really know that, but that’s what she did to help stay fit during pregnancy.\nHere is a 3 page printable workout the “Duchess Inspired Workout” with some yoga-style exercises (my versions of course).\nCLICK HERE TO PRINT! \n\n \n\n\nSign up here for my Knocked-Up Fitness Newsletter so you don’t miss any new printouts, not just for you pregnant mommas but after baby & beyond too!\nPlus if your on instagram I’d love to see you working out, use #KnockedUpFitness & you can follow me @KnockedUpFit\nNow what are you waiting for!
