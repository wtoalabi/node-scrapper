"I’m going to tell you something a liiittle controversial, but I’m going to speak up because it needs to be talked about in women’s health.\n\n\n\n>>Kegels are not an effective way to strengthen your pelvic floor.<<\n\n\n\nNow, I know that that’s a different take than what you’ve been taught in the past, so let me explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom what I’ve learned about the pelvic floor, I believe that the old-school way of doing Kegels is not supporting your pelvic floor function and is actually causing harm to your body.\n\n\n\nIt starts with women having too tight of a pelvic floor.Then that turns into peeing their pants when they go for a run.And even with wet Lululemon leggins, they continue to push their bodies harder.\n\n\n\nAre you feeling called out? *Sorry, but I’m here to tell you the truth.*\n\n\n\nIf this post is making you think of reasons why you can’t take a step back from your runs to focus on your pelvic floor health, I actually don’t want to hear it.\n\n\n\n>>Because oftentimes, we create excuses instead of taking a look at our habits and then making a change.<<\n\n\n\nIt’s easy to get defensive and tell me all of the reasons you don’t have time or why it won’t work for you. It’s harder to be open-minded and say, “I’m ready for change. Tell me more.”\n\n\n\nSo for those of you who are asking for more, I’ll give it to you: Connect with your pelvic floor through breath, visualization, and gentle movement.\n\n\n\nWomen workout to be healthy.\n\n\n\nThey want to feel empowered.They want to feel confident.They want to feel strong.\n\n\n\nBut you are not going to feel those things if you continue to do Kegels, push through the pain, and tell yourself that this is just a part of having a baby. You have the power to heal your body, but you have to make that choice.\n\n\n\nThese are the kinds of choices that will allow you to keep up with your kids as they age.\n\n\n\n>>You’re not going to get rid of incontinence by putting pressure on your pelvic floor with a Kegel. You get rid of incontinence by finding the balance between strengthening and releasing your pelvic floor.<<\n\n\n\nHowever, your pelvic floor isn’t going to heal itself overnight.\n\n\n\nConsistency leads to results.\n\n\n\nIt begins to get rid of back pain.It begins to make you feel energized.It begins to improve your gut function.It begins to get rid of brain fog.It begins to wake up your pelvic floor.It begins to create a body-mind connection.\n\n\n\n>>But none of this is possible if you don’t take a step back from high-intensity workouts to connect with your body in a new way.<<\n\n\n\nIs it a magic pill? Absolutely not.\n\n\n\nCan it give you the results you want? I’ve seen it!\n\n\n\nThat’s why I continue to stand my ground on the topic of Kegels because I care about you and your health.\n\n\n\nIt may not be the advice you want to hear, but it’s the advice that works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou deserve to live your life without dysfunction, and I want to help you learn how to heal in my upcoming masterclass, The Pelvic Floor’s Role In Healing Your Body. \n\n\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn in my free class:\n\n\n\nWhat to do to get rid of peeing your pants when you run, laugh, jump, or sneezeHow to decrease back pain, neck pain, hip pain, pelvis pain, and more discomfortsThe best way to heal diastasis recti and improve pelvic floor function…and more!\n\n\n\nIf you’re feeling empowered and motivated to take control of your health, I’d be honored to be your guide.
