"Whether you are an expecting mom, postpartum or beyond, or a fitness professional you need to know what pelvic organ prolapse is!\nI am finding it as a ‘silent issue’ faced my way too many women – for many, preventable. Watch my video as I explain more about what pelvic organ prolapse is and how you can do something to prevent NOW, and even help with symptoms after.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThere are many variables of pelvic organ prolapse; when the bladder, uterus or intestines protrude down through an opening in the pelvic floor.\nIncontinence and pelvic organ prolapse do not necessarily come hand in hand, but it is through similar methods that you can work to prevent and heal. I teach this method to mamas in my Prenatal + Postnatal Membership and professional instructors in my Pre/Postnatal Exercise Specialist Course.\nWe can change the way we strengthen our core, or as a fitness professional, change the way you teach your clients how to strengthen their deep core! In doing this, we work to open up conversation about these words:\n\nPelvic Floor\nIncontinence\nPelvic Organ Prolapse (of which there are variables of prolapsing)\n\nTogether we can help open up this conversation. If you find yourself having a conversation with other women who mention that ‘peeing your pants’ is just a ‘normal part of life after kids’ – speak up and inform her otherwise!\nMost women really just do NOT know! It’s more about not knowing than knowing what to do. That’s the next step!\nIt brings tears to my eyes when I rethink about the countless conversations I’ve had with women who were told there is nothing they can do (except for surgery) to fix:\n\nIncontinence\nDiastasis Recti\nMinimal prolapsing symptoms\n\nThat’s SO beyond the truth… many women who have participated in my Core Rehab Program have experienced great improvement in the above (incontinence, diastasis recti, prolapse symptoms). There is hope and you CAN do something about each of these.\nTypically, the only time surgery is the only answer is with a full pelvic organ prolapse (where things fall all the way out). BUT let’s work on strengthening the deep core properly so that doesn’t happen (because it can!).\nSo whether you are expecting, a new mama, an experienced mama or a fitness professional, know that we need to be talking about this because it can be prevented!\nNot sure if an exercise is appropriate for you or a client just ask these questions:\n\nCan you/she feel pain or pressure pushing down on her pelvic floor?\nAre you/is she experiencing any incontinence with that movement/exercise?\n\nIf you/she answered “YES” to either or both of those questions then it’s time to rethink that movement/exercise.\nFitness Professionals you can learn all the details about my Pre/Postnatal Exercise Specialist Course here (not just for those that specialist but for every instructor that works with female clients).\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nTags: incontinence, Pelvic Floor, pelvic organ prolapse, prolapseShare:"
