"I get asked often “Can I lie on my back while pregnant?” and it’s an important pregnancy question that comes up a lot, about laying on your back during pregnancy.\nWhile, yes, some women may need to avoid laying on their backs into their 2nd & 3rd trimesters, many are perfectly ok too for short periods of time. Your doctor should tell you if you can’t (mostly common in more high risk pregnancies) in which case you may not be exercising.\n\nFor the average healthy, fit pregnant female you CAN  lay on your back for short periods of time here and there. Try keeping it to no longer then 5-10 minutes at a time.\nYour body will tell you if it’s time to get up. You may feel nauseous, dizzy, etc.\nFor myself and many of my clients we all love the short relief you can get from just a couple minutes on your back and doing some hip rolls. {a great exercise for releasing tension in your low back}. For much more about exercising during pregnancy, boosting your confidence, preparing your body for delivery and an easier recovery postpartum my Knocked-Up Fitness Membership is designed just for your pregnancy journey!\nEven my Ob Gyn supports most women being on her back for short periods of time!\n“You are absolutely right in the advice you give. Short periods on your back are generally fine. It is only a problem if a pregnant uterus inhibits return of blood to the heart. If so, a patient may feel nausea, etc. Once they adjust their position, the symptoms resolve. There are no long term harmful effects to mom or baby.” – Dr. Gigi Kroll {as quoted in my book The Knocked Up Fitness Guide to Pregnancy}\nNote: Once into your 2nd & 3rd trimesters roll to your side & use your arms to help you get up to avoid overusing your rectus abdominals. I’m finding this can really help minimize ab separation.\n \n\n If there’s ever an exercise you’re just not comfortable doing when pregnant the simple answer is “don’t do it”!\n\nIf you’re up for an exercise lying on your back I LOVE these hip rolls (and even pelvic tilts), trying keeping your range of motion in your back as long as you can.\nThis can help those low back aches and pains. Movement is an amazing thing for the body, especially during pregnancy and it’s the best time to learn to strengthen your deep core muscles properly!\nI can’t tell you the amount of times my pregnant clients leave their workouts feeling amazing, and that’s how your workouts should leave you feeling too – better than when you started!\n \n\n \nFocus on articulating one vertebrae at a time up & down, moving slowly. You should feel your glutes, hamstrings, and deep core muscles working here.\n\n\nTags: 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, back, Butt, Core, exercise, Hip Rolls, Low Back, Lying on your back, pregnancy instructor, prenatal exercise, Prenatal Fitness, prenatal instructor, Prenatal PilatesShare:"
