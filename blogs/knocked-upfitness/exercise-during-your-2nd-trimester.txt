"ALWAYS…LISTEN TO YOUR BODY!\nThank goodness for the “Golden Trimester”, well for most anyway.  Take advantage of feeling better during your 2nd trimester.  If you weren’t able to exercise during your 1st trimester but you feel better now, then get moving.\nIf you haven’t been exercising and are starting now, that’s ok, just follow the same guidelines as exercising during your 1st trimester.  Start slow & keep it basic.\nRemember the many potential benefits of exercising during pregnancy:\n\nPrepares your body for labor & delivery\nHelps you feel good\nKeeps you as “pain-free” as possible\nHelps maintain/create good posture\nReturn to your pre-pregnancy weight sooner & easier\nEasier recovery after baby\n\nModifications to make as you enter your 2nd trimester :\n\nYour belly is getting bigger (I don’t have to tell you that!)\nAs your baby grows & your belly gets bigger avoid lying on your back for long periods of time. Some doctors tell their patients not to lie on their backs at all, so of course listen to your doctor if he/she tells you this (just skip those exercises when working out). Unless you have a high-risk pregnancy or other medical reason, I recommend you can still lie on your back up to 5 minutes at a time, IF YOU FEEL OK.  Signs that you shouldn’t lie on your back or need to get up: if you begin to feel nauseas, dizzy, lightheaded, or just don’t feel good lying on your back. The best way to get up from lying on your back is to roll to your left side & then stand up.\nAnother modification you will need to make as you get into your 2nd trimester, no more lying on your stomach. Usually by this time your belly will be big enough that you should no longer do any exercises on your stomach, for obvious reasons.\nAs your baby continues to grow you have more weight pulling on your low back.  This is why many woman experience low back pain (although you don’t have to). As you enter your 2nd trimester this is the time you need to really be aware of your posture, stand tall, shoulders back, think about “tucking” your tailbone under & pull your belly in & up. These tips can help relieve pressure into your low back. As your belly grows you may tend to just let your back hold your weight, stop now as it will only continue to get worse as your baby grows & you have even more weight pulling on your back. Your back is only as strong as your abs!\nOne last thing, avoid overstretch.  You can still do stretching exercises just DO NOT push your end range.  When stretching, only go through a range that feels good to you, don’t aim for a deep stretch.  Hormone changes during pregnancy allow your joints to become more flexible (needed to allow your hips to open for delivery) but you’re not there yet, so just be careful.  Be most cautious of inner thigh exercises, & especially stretching your inner thighs.  They are still important & need to be done, just keep your range of motion small & comfortable.\n\n*Check with your Doc to make sure you are cleared to exercise during your pregnancy* \n(You may go through a period where you need to take it easy but after a few days or weeks you can get moving again)\n\n \n\nTips:\n\nAim for 30-60 minutes of cardio exercise everyday (yes, walking counts),\nAim for at least 3 hours of cardio/week to maximize your benefits\nAim for strength resistance exercise 2-4 times/week. (Lightweight exercises, pilates, & yoga, count)\nStay hydrated. Always carry a bottle of water, preferably not plastic. (If you are thirsty you are dehydrated)\nWear layers so you can easily remove outer ones when you get warm\nAvoid exercise outside in hot humid temperatures or indoors for that matter either if it hot inside\nWear good supportive tennis shoes\nRemember, your body is changing so you may find it easy to lose your balance\n\n\nTags: 2nd Trimester, Erica Ziel, exercise, exercise modifications, knocked-up fitness, Pilates, pregnancy, pregnancy exercise, pregnancy fitness, prenatal exercise, Prenatal Fitness, stages of pregnancy, symptoms during pregnancy, week-by-week pregnancy, YogaShare:"
