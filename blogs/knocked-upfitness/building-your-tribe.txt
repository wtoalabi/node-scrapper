"“Surround yourself with the dreamers, the doers, the believers and the thinkers, but most of all, surround yourself with those who see the greatness within you, even when you don’t see it yourself. ~Edmund Lee\nHave you ever noticed how your attitude and energy changes depending on your company? When you’re around positive, uplifting individuals, you usually feel happy and energetic, right?\nBecause we are human, we tend to be heavily influenced by the individuals we choose to surround ourselves with. These influencers play a major role in forming our mindset, energy, feelings and behaviors.\nHow do you ensure you are surrounding yourself with the right people?  Here are my 4 tips to building your ride or die tribe.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nLIKE ATTRACTS LIKE\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t“Happiness is like change…it starts from within.”\nBefore focusing your attention on others, I recommend looking inward first. How is your attitude? How do you treat people? What does your mindset look like? What kind of energy are you giving off?  These questions are important to think about because you will attract the same energy you are putting out.  Like attracts like.  Happiness is a choice and in order to attract positive, uplifting people that are going to believe in you, you have to embody those traits first.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nBIRDS OF A FEATHER...\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t“You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life.”\nHaving friends that have like-minded morals, ethics and lifestyle choices can make conversations and get-togethers more enjoyable and fulfilling. We all need individuals in our lives to bounce ideas off of, get advice from and vent to. So, if you are passionate about health and wellness and want to live a holistic lifestyle, having these like-minded individuals can help ensure the advice you seek is in line with your way of thinking and living.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nHONESTY + INTEGRITY\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t“Speak with honesty, think with sincerity and act with integrity.”\nTrue friends are hard to find, but when you do, you realize just how valuable they are.  True friends will be there for you through thick and thin and not judge you when you are at your worst. They will also be the ones to tell you when you can’t pull off that dress or when you need an attitude adjustment.  Think of these individuals as a compass or guide.  They will not be “yes people” and just tell you what you want to hear.  They will be honest with you because they truly have your best interest at heart.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nTWO-WAY STREET\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t“Be the rainbow in someone else’s cloud.”\nFriendship is a two-way street so make sure you are putting in equal time and effort into the relationship. Not everything is about you even when you are going through a rough patch. Take the time to listen to the other person(s) and give them your undivided attention. As we all know, life is like a roller coaster, there are ups and downs.  But with great company, that journey can be a lot easier and filled with love and laughter.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIf you are ready to upgrade your health, wellness or business, apply for one-on-one training with Erica.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: After Baby, baby, cold season, flu season, health tip, Health tips, healthy baby, healthy kids, Healthy Lifestyle, healthy pregnancy, Healthy Tips, knocked-up fitness, Nutrition, Postpartum, pregnancy, pregnancy health, pregnant, pregnant women, prenatal health, Real moms, Real talkShare:"
