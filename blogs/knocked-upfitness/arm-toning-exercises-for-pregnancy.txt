"Mama…Are you wanting to keep your arms toned during pregnancy?\n\n\n\nI’ll be honest, I still incorporate these movements into my workout routine and my youngest is 10!\n\n\n\nBut it’s more than just going through the motions that makes arm toning exercises safe for pregnancy.\n\n\n\n>>It’s about learning how to connect with your body and your growing baby bump.<<\n\n\n\nAre you ready to understand what I’m talking about?\n\n\n\nIf so, let’s chat about 3 arm toning exercises for pregnancy and beyond!\n\n\n\n1. Tricep Kickbacks\n\n\n\nAs you go into your stance, lift up lightly through your deep core, soften your knees, and send your booty back.\n\n\n\n>>You want to be using your butt in this position so pain doesn’t go into your low back.<<\n\n\n\nGive your baby a gentle hug and keep your elbows at your side.\n\n\n\nOn your exhale, extend your arms back and inhale to release them a little bit.\n\n\n\nYou can do 10-20 of these while using a light weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Shoulder Raises\n\n\n\nLift up tall as you connect with your pelvic floor and lower belly.\n\n\n\nWith your elbows by your side and your arms at a 90° angle, scoop down, out, and up.\n\n\n\n>>Lead with your elbows to keep any tension out of your neck.<<\n\n\n\nContinue to lift up from your mid-back and across your chest.\n\n\n\nYou’re going to feel like you’re sticking your boobs out…and that’s okay!\n\n\n\nThen control your arms back down and repeat for 10-15 reps.\n\n\n\n3. Reverse Flyes\n\n\n\nWith this third exercise, you are going to go into the same position as the tricep kickbacks.\n\n\n\n>>I don’t like to do these movements back to back because I want to make sure that you don’t risk any pain going into your low back by being in that position for too long.<<\n\n\n\nOnce you’re there, create a soft bend in your elbows as you reach out and up. \n\n\n\n*You should feel a strong mid-back connection.*\n\n\n\nExperiment with these by taking your arms back by your hips and more shoulder height to see what feels best for you.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to open up your chest and look out in front of you as you do about 10-15 reps of this exercise.\n\n\n\nIt IS possible to not have any low back pain due to extreme postural shifts during pregnancy.\n\n\n\n>>A lot of why that is comes down to being aware of how you’re carrying your body.<<\n\n\n\nThese mid-back strengthening exercises will not only tone your arms but support your neck and head to help avoid any unnecessary aches and pains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more exercises to add to your prenatal movement practice, grab our free Pregnancy Workout!
