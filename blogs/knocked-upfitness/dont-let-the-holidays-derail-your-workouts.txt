"Shanna: She started off amazing (losing 3 inches off her belly in 1 week!) & then, well as what happens to most of us with little ones “life happens” & as she put it “survival mode” kicked in. Although I can be sure that she was burning lots of calories running around after her little ones. Back on board tomorrow with her kick-butt workouts & healthy lifestyle diet.\nSometimes just being “Ok” with not getting a workout in is alright, as long as you don’t let it keep happening. Traveling with little ones is one of the biggest challenges of having kids (that’s my opinion anyway), so you do what works to keep everyone as happy as possible. Cranky kids can make a cranky momma & no one want’s that 😉\nHow do you stay on track when life throws you “CrAziNeSs”?\nMe: I keep my eating in check when I know I’m not able to exercise like I want to.\n~E\n \nCheck Out These Other Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\n\n\n\t\n\nHuffington Post Live Segment: Staying Fit During Pregnancy!\n\n\n\n\t\n\nPOPSUGAR Live! 4 At-Home Prenatal & Postpartum Exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTry Fitbook to help keep you accountable.\n\n]]>\t\t\nTags: After Baby, Cardio, Christmas, Core, Erica Ziel, exercise, Fitness, healthy holidays, knocked-up fitness, lose the baby weight, Nutrition, Real moms, Real talk, running, Weight LossShare:"
