"Learn how to prepare for birth and recovery postpartum with your pre + postnatal coaches. There is a lot of information out there and I wanted to help bring awareness, educate and empower women so they can make the best decisions for their bodies! \n\n\n\nWhere did this all start?\n\n\n\nSeveral years ago, my girlfriends and clients convinced me to start this blog allÂ about prenatal exercise. They believed that my style of teaching needed to be experienced in mainstream fitness.\n\n\n\nLittle did I know thatÂ thatÂ push wouldÂ leadÂ me to where Iâ€™m at today: in an online space where Iâ€™m able to provide women with a prenatal membership, a postpartum recovery program and even an instructor course.\n\n\n\nSoâ€¦I think itâ€™s safe to say that I have helpedÂ thousandsÂ of women prepare their bodies for pregnancy, birth and postpartum recovery. Iâ€™ve also inspired others to do the same through teaching this way of training.\n\n\n\nThis is where Annie comes in ðŸ™‚\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnie joined my Knocked-Up Fitness team inÂ 2015 with the eagerness toÂ educateÂ andÂ empowerÂ women during their pregnancy journey.\n\n\n\nAsÂ you will learn from tuning into our conversation, is that the pregnancy journey startsÂ well beforeÂ you are pregnant.\n\n\n\nSociety tends toÂ segment out preparing your body for pregnancy,Â pregnancy itselfÂ and postpartum recovery. BUT Annie and I believe that they areÂ all intertwined.\n\n\n\nHereâ€™s how weâ€™re breaking it down:\n\n\n\nThings to do to prepare your body for pregnancy BEFORE youâ€™re pregnant.Â (3:57)What to do now that youâ€™re pregnant.Â (8:37)Working on prevention of body dysfunctions for a smoother postpartum recovery.Â (13:29)How Kegels are causing your pelvic floor to be too tightâ€¦ and thatâ€™s a big no-no.Â (16:03)What you do during pregnancy affects how your birth goes (even for c-sections).Â (19:37)Annie and Iâ€™s first birth experiences and what we learned.Â (23:27)HowÂ Annie wants you toÂ think about labor and delivery.Â (29:38)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItâ€™s never too late to take care of your body or implement any of the things Annie and I discussed.Â If youâ€™ve been feeling tired, stressed and overwhelmed while still wanting aÂ prepped body for birth,Â youâ€™re going to want to join us in our prenatal membership.
