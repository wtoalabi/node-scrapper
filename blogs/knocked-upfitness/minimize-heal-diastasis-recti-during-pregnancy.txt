"I have talked to thousands of women about diastasis recti during pregnancy. You know the most common question I get about it?\n\n\n\nNo, mama, it’s not how to pronounce it…because to each their own on that one!\n\n\n\n>>How can I test to see if I have diastasis recti during pregnancy?<<\n\n\n\nI don’t test any of my pregnant clients and I don’t recommend you test yourself either. You are ideally going to want to wait until you are 8-10 weeks postpartum before you try to test for diastasis recti for yourself.\n\n\n\nBut, before we go any further, let’s reframe the way we talk about diastasis. Instead of attaching fear to the topic of diastasis recti, I want you to start thinking about this as something you can work to prevent, minimize and heal.\n\n\n\nHere are a few key items to pay attention to:\n\n\n\n1. Coning of the belly. If you experience any coning of the belly (ridge or bump instead of your round belly), this is your body’s way of telling you that you are putting too much pressure on your Linea Alba (the fibrous structure that runs down the midline of your abdominals). If this occurs, stop doing that particular exercise temporarily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Use your breath. Your breath has a huge impact on how you feel physically, mentally + emotionally. I want you to sit on a mat, chair or ball at home and just breathe. On your inhale, visualize your breath going deep into your low back and pelvis. On your exhale, visualize all the tension leaving your body. Repeat this several times. Using this exercise throughout your day can help you destress, relax and alleviate tension throughout your body.\n\n\n\n3. Connect through your pelvic floor + deep core. Knowing how to properly engage and release your pelvic floor and low belly is key to minimizing, preventing and healing Diastasis Recti. AND…the best time to learn this is during pregnancy because you have that tactile feedback from your baby. \n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, what it comes down to is if you are bringing awareness to the way you are holding your bump.\n\n\n\nIf the answer is yes, then you are on the right track.\n\n\n\nAnd when you start to make these connections in your body, I hope you begin to understand the potential of being able to feel better stronger and more empowered after baby.\n\n\n\nBecause you’ve got this mama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like even MORE information on diastasis recti during pregnancy, check out my Knocked-Up Fitness® Membership!
