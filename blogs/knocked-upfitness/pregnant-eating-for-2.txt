"“Eating for 2” – Don’t get carried away…\nWhen eating for 2 you really should not eat double the amount of food & calories. I don’t understand that! I do understand cravings, & hungry urges during pregnancy that are so strong you can’t resist. So, give in A LITTLE! Control is key.\nTips to help overcome over eating (pregnant or not)\n\nDrink plenty of water throughout your day – at least 8, 8oz glasses, more if your a regular exerciser (which you should be)\nEat a healthy filling breakfast – try oatmeal w/berries, eggs w/avocado\nKeep your sugar intake in check & eat only real sugar/nothing fake\nEat small meals/snacks every 2-4 hours\nKeep the junk out of your house/ Avoid anything Processed/things in packages & cans (hate to break it to you, it’s not good for you!)\nEat fruits & veggies regularly – aim for 1 serving every time you eat\nExercise everyday – even if just going for a walk\n\n\nWhat “Eating for 2” really means\n\n1st trimester: an extra 200-300 calories/day\n2nd Trimester: an extra 200-300 calories/day\n3rd trimester: an extra 300 calories/day\nBreastfeeding: an EXTRA 500 calories/day\nThese are all estimates, but in reality this is the average additional calories you need during your pregnancy. Your total weight gain should be 25-35 pounds (this will vary depending on who you talk to).\nIf you are underweight you should gain towards the higher end of the recommended weight gain, possible more\nIf you are overweight you should gain towards the lower end of the recommended weight gain\n\nYour weight gained WILL come off! or maybe I should rephrase myself, “Your weight CAN come off”. For some this is much easier than others. Don’t worry if you gain more than 35-40 pounds. For some, maybe that’s what your body requires to carry a new life inside. The question you must ask is “Am I eating healthy nutrient dense foods that are good for my baby?” If you answered “yes” & you just can’t control your weight gain than ok, just be honest with yourself. If you answered “no” then you need to be double checking what you are putting in your mouth.\n\nYour baby eats/drinks everything you do 🙂\nBreastfeeding is when your appetite really starts to kick in. Don’t stray away from eating, you really do need to eat more to supply nutrient rich milk for your newborn. Even though your appetite kicks in like crazy when you start breastfeeding your weight will continue to come off.\nKeeping a food/exercise journal throughout your pregnancy & after can be a great way to help you see what you really are eating & your exercise. Trust me it can help. For many it’s hard to really see what you are eating until you see it written down on a piece of paper.\nEat Healthy for a Healthy Baby 🙂\n\n \nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, Breastfeeding, Cravings, Eating for 2, Erica Ziel, Heal, Health tips, Healthy Eats, healthy pregnancy, healthy pregnancy eating, hydration, knocked-up fitness, Nutrition, pregnancy, pregnancy health, Pregnancy Health Tips, WeightShare:"
