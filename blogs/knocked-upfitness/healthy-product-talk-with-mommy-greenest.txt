"I was super excited to meet with Rachel from Mommy Greenest to talk all about healthy and “green” habits/products you should be using to live a healthier lifestyle! Not just for you but for your family too. It’s amazing when you stop to think about what toxins are all around us and with some small changes we can greatly decrease those toxins. So watch my interview with Rachel and I’d love for you to leave a comment below and share you’re own healthy habits/products you love as well.\n===>Sign-up here for my Knocked-Up Fitness newsletter!\n\n \nCheck out The Honest Company here, I have been using their products since they first came out when my 3rd was born and have LOVED their products!\nFor more from Rachel check out her blog here.\nCheck out the Environmental Workout Group here.\nTags: After Baby, baby, Baby Products, Eco friendly, Erica Ziel, Green Products, healthy habits, Healthy Lifestyle, healthy pregnancy, Healthy Tips, Honest Company, Kids, knocked-up fitness, mom products, Mommy Greenest, My Favorites, Postpartum, pregnancy, pregnancy health, prenatal health, Rachel Sarnoff, Real moms, Real talk, removing toxins, safety, toxinsShare:"
