"When I first got pregnant, my friends told me two things…\n\nMake time for yourself\nMake time for your partner\n\nWhen our baby was born, I was constantly looking for ways to do both! Well, ladies, I have found the perfect combo… GYM DATES! I know, I know… but hear me out because if done right, it can be a blast!!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nTIME + PLACE\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFind a time and place that works for you.\nThere are so many great places to enjoy a workout together. You can meet in your backyard for an afternoon workout, the gym or a nature area for a hike.\nFor us, it’s our gym where there is childcare. Wherever it is, make sure you both agree on the place and time. This will help decrease any anxiety or stress and make the workout that much more enjoyable!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nCHOOSE THE WORKOUT\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSelect a workout that is NEW for both of you.\nDuring one of our first gym dates, we started The Core Rehab Program. The core work was equally challenging for both of us and was something we really enjoy doing together.\nGet creative with your workouts!! Go rock climbing, take a hot yoga class or go for a bike ride on a new trail. Whatever adventure you choose, enjoy the time with your partner.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nHAVE FUN\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDon’t take yourselves too seriously. \nGym dates work because you both are in a stress-free zone where the endorphins are flowing. Keep it fun and light and don’t get too competitive, mama!!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nBE PATIENT\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKnow your emotional limit.  \nIt can be really hard to leave your baby at first. Our first few gym dates were only about 30 minutes long. As time goes on and you get more comfortable, you can extend your gym dates.\nThe key to making gym dates work is being in the moment and enjoying something new with your partner. Take it slow and enjoy whatever time you can allow with each other!!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCombining your workout and couple time is a great way to stay healthy, have fun and spend quality time with your partner!  And if gym dates are just not your thing, you can still apply these tips to whatever activity makes you happy!\nHappy Bumpin! \n~Coach Annie\n \nTo learn more about the Prenatal + Core Rehab Membership or the Prenatal Exercise Specialist Instructor Course, visit our website!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: After Baby, baby, cold season, flu season, health tip, Health tips, healthy baby, healthy kids, Healthy Lifestyle, healthy pregnancy, Healthy Tips, knocked-up fitness, Nutrition, Postpartum, pregnancy, pregnancy health, pregnant, pregnant women, prenatal health, Real moms, Real talkShare:"
