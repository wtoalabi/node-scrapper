"I love kneeling side reaches because they are great for creating space and opposition throughout the body and opening up those hips + chest. AND…you can do these throughout your entire pregnancy! \n\n\n\nTo get started, grab a mat. If you’re on a hard surface, you might want to think about doubling up your mats for some additional cushion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Kneeling Side Reaches\n\n\n\nTake your bottom leg and really wrap around your hipActively open up the front of your hipsLightly connect through your pelvic floor + deep coreLightly hugging your babyPlace your hand on the floor, opening up across your chestThink about getting that expansion across your shouldersTake your top leg and top arm up, creating that great opposition throughout your bodyOn your exhale, bring your elbow and leg toward each otherUse your glutes so you don’t dump into your low backNOTE: If you’re in your 3rd trimester, focus on rounding your back and only moving through a range of motion that feels good for your bodyOn your inhale, open up, staying connected through your body Look up towards your fingertips for even more oppositionOn your exhale, look down and repeat Do 5-10 reps on each sideYou can add a few side lying leg lifts for some additional work!\n\n\n\nModifications\n\n\n\nOption 1: Instead of doing kneeling side reaches, you can lie on your side and just do 10-20 side lying leg lifts on each side. Option 2: Mermaid. These are great for some upper body work as well as getting that opposition throughout your body.\n\n\n\nRemember to only work through a range of motion that feels good for your body and stay connected through your deep core + pelvic floor!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are ready for more prenatal movements like this one, you need to join us in my Knocked-Up Fitness® Membership.\n\n\n\nIt includes weekly workout schedules, TONS of workouts to choose from and access to our prenatal coaches whenever you’re feeling lost or overwhelmed.
