"When you’re trying to conceive, it’s easy to get caught up in the myths that claim to help your chances of getting pregnant. In fact, there are probably more myths than truths hanging around, and separating the two can be difficult (especially since many of the myths are based on facts!). Here are five of the most common myths you shouldn’t believe if you’re trying to conceive!\n\nWe’ll conceive as soon as I stop my birth control. When you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, everyone tells you that no birth control is 100% effective, but you can ask many couples and they’ll tell you: going off birth control doesn’t mean you’ll get pregnant on the first try! For most oral contraceptives, once you finish taking them (or for other contraceptives as soon as they are out of your system and you ovulate) you can conceive, but it won’t always happen in the first cycle, so don’t worry! It’s normal for many couples to try for several months before conceiving!\nWomen ovulate 14 days into their cycle, so that’s when we should try. This myth in particular is a case of fact-gone-wrong. For an average, 28-day cycle, ovulation might occur around 14 days. However, every woman’s cycle is a little different, and since an egg is only viable for about 12-24 hours; ovulation prediction kits, basal body temperature, charting, and other personalized methods can increase your chances of conceiving.\nI’m under 35, so infertility won’t be an issue. This myth is actually a 2-for-1. First, it’s a common misconception that infertility is usually a female issue, since in almost 50% of cases, it is the male partner experiencing fertility issues. Also, age isn’t necessarily a definite factor either: while fertility issues are more common with advanced maternal age, many young couples experience infertility just the same, which is why it is recommended to see a doctor to rule out underlying issues before trying to conceive (see below!).\nWe’re both pretty healthy, so we can start trying now. While you and your partner probably feel 100% ready to start trying to conceive, it’s a good idea for you both to see your physician(s) before getting pregnant. A basic check-up, blood work, and a chat with your doctor can go a long way in ruling out any issues, and getting the go ahead that you’re body is as ready for baby as you are!\nGravity will do the work! There are SO many myths about using gravity to help (or prevent) conception, including adjusting to positions that are most effective, and the notion that laying on your back will help move things along. There is no research confirming that your physical positioning has any effect on conception– but if you feel like it will help, we’re not stopping you from changing things up (we’ll leave this one up to you)!\nSo whether you’re thinking about trying soon, or actively waiting for a big fat positive, don’t get too caught up in the myths surrounding conception. Just remember to stay healthy and talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.\n\n \nSources:\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/birth-control/in-depth/birth-control-pill/art-20045136\nhttp://americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/understandingovulation.html\nhttp://americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/ttc35.html\nhttp://www.whattoexpect.com/preconception/conception-myths.aspx#\nTags: conception, Erica Ziel, exercise, Fitness, getting pregnant, health, healthy pregnancy, Julianna, knocked-up fitness, Nutrition, pregnancy, pregnancy fitness, pregnancy health, pregnant, pregnant women, stages of pregnancy, week-by-week pregnancyShare:"
