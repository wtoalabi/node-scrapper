"pregnant and moving through my exercises, or you’re a busy mama, breath is so important for helping to connect our deep core muscles.\n\n\n\n\nBreath can easily be overlooked, it can be challenging to connect the breath properly, and it may take a while to consistently feel the difference. I will discuss a few different ways to get you on the road to better breathing today!\n\n\n\n\nBelow are a few pointers, and be sure to watch my video![/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=\".vc_custom_1547505026055{margin-bottom: 0px !important;}\"]Tips for Incorporating Mindful Breathing into Pregnancy & Beyond:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s About More Than Kegels: think about a full-body, deep-core connection and not just doing your Kegels\n\n\n\n\nWhere You Keep Your Stress: be aware of the stress you keep in your shoulders and neck. Are you clenching your jaw? Is your neck tight? Breath into these areas to soften and de-stress.\n\n\n\n\nPosture: we talk a lot about posture, and how important it is for core strength. Having great posture helps us breathe into our ribs and back, not just our chest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, now I want you to try! Follow along in the video {above} or use these cues to help you maintain mindful breath and relieve stress:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want you to use a chair, and sit up nice and tall {remember we’re sitting on our sitz-bones}, and think about breathing in and out to our sides and back. When we can get that breath to go down farther, and out, and then back, we’re getting so much more oxygen into our body. When we do that, it’s a natural way to relieve stress.\n\n\n\n\nAnother exercise you can try is breathing in and out very slowly, let’s say six to eight counts if you can go that long, or working up to that. Then when you exhale, try breathing out through your mouth and thinking about breathing out for eight counts as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=\".vc_custom_1547505049172{margin-bottom: 0px !important;}\"][/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=\".vc_custom_1547505181828{margin-bottom: 0px !important;}\"]Looking for safe and effective exercises which focus on creating balance throughout your body, strengthen your deep core muscles and focus on your breath with movement my Prenatal + Postnatal Membership!
