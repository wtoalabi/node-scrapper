"Do you like icing on your cake?\n\n\n\n*Like itâ€™s on there but do you really need it?*\n\n\n\nThatâ€™s kind of the same way to look at taking prenatal supplements (whether youâ€™re pregnant or not)!\n\n\n\nPrenatal supplements are important to nourish your body during pregnancyâ€¦but you donâ€™t need to rely on them.\n\n\n\nWhat you should rely on is:\n\n\n\nEating nutritious, organic foodMinimizing foods with pesticidesAvoiding toxicity\n\n\n\n>>Whether you like icing on your cake or not, learning about these prenatal supplements could impact how you feel throughout your pregnancy.<<\n\n\n\nBecause baby will take from your body what it needs leaving you the one feeling depleted.\n\n\n\nIf youâ€™re ready to feel more nourished while youâ€™re bumping, then letâ€™s talk about 3 of my recommended prenatal supplements that you need in your cabinet.\n\n\n\n*Itâ€™s recommended that you talk with your doctor before adding in any supplements to your diet.*\n\n\n\nElectrolytes\n\n\n\nI didnâ€™t know about this one with any of my three pregnancies and I think it would have really helped me with my energy!\n\n\n\nThese arenâ€™t only good for pregnancy but for any stage in a womanâ€™s life because they:\n\n\n\nMake sure you stay hydratedAid in transporting nutrientsCreate a good mineral balance in your bodyGive a burst of energy\n\n\n\nI pour my Seeking Health electrolyte sticks into my water every day and drink them over a period of time but NEVER after 3-4 pm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrenatal Vitamin\n\n\n\nThe number one thing to look for a prenatal vitamin is to see if they have folate in them.\n\n\n\n>>You really, really, really do NOT want to be eating or taking supplements that have folic acid in them.<<\n\n\n\nI know for years it was taught to take folic acid, but I have read enough research out there that says that it could be connected to miscarriages.\n\n\n\nThis prenatal from Seeking Health and this one from Holistic Health are both awesome recommendations that we love for our mamas!\n\n\n\nOmega and Choline\n\n\n\nThis is the combo that you need to make sure that you are getting good fats in your body for better brain function for baby AND you.\n\n\n\n>>Supplementation is good for baby, but you are doing it for you as well mama so you can minimize depletion in your body as much as possible.<<\n\n\n\nDuring pregnancy, there is a decrease in the availability of choline so adding a supplement can help those levels get back to average (I love this one from Seeking Health). As far as your omega goes, in my opinion as long as it has EPA and DHA you canâ€™t go wrong and this Seeking Health one does just that.\n\n\n\nSidenote: This Mommy Brain supplement from Vitamin IQ is also a MUST for moms!\n\n\n\nThere you have it, mama: 3 prenatal supplements that you need in your cabinet!\n\n\n\nIf this is your first pregnancy or you last, these supplementation tips are important to keep up while youâ€™re nursing and inbetween babiesâ€¦but at the end of the day, all that matters is that mom and baby are healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf youâ€™d like to learn more insight from me and my other Knocked-Up Fitness coaches, youâ€™ll want to join us in our prenatal membership.Â As a member, you get access to our coaches during our group calls, private Facebook group and email!
