"10 weeks later…Shanna has gotten her momma’s groove back & is grooving into her PRE-BABY Jeans! \nWhat an amazing feeling & sense of accomplishment! \nKeep it up Girl!\n\n Through all her hard times & feeling like it ain’t possible…well IT IS! Shanna is proof that you can get your pre-baby body back (is she 100% there yet, well no, but she’s getting damn closer every day!).\nDoes your body change after having kids, absolutley! \nCan it be the same? YES! \nYour body may take on a slightly different shape after having a couple kids. But that doesn’t mean you can’t rock your new momma bod! Many mom’s love their body even more after kids, as YOU should! Hell girl, you did after all go through a crazy 9 months of body changes, supporting another human being, delivering baby, nursing, & on top of that forget even thinking about hormonal changes! Take that times what, 2 or 3 babies…that’s a lot going on for one body to handle. Don’t be so hard on yourself but realize you need to make you a priority.\nWhat are you doing to keep (or get) your bod in rockin’ shape?\n~E\n\n\nTags: After Baby, Fitness, Getting Momma's Groove Back, OC, Pre-Baby Jeans, Real moms, Shanna, Weight LossShare:"
