"Spring into Summer Series with Knocked-Up Fitness and Me2Roo. Here is the final workout “Yoga Fit Workout” in this three week workout video series – designed for you during pregnancy, after baby, and beyond! \nBe sure to follow the modifications if you are in your 2nd or 3rd trimester and right after baby, or if you just aren’t ready to do the full version. Check out the image below the video for pictures of all the exercises.  Keep sharing with your friends! I highly recommend Me2Roo Maternity and Lifestyle wear (check them out in the videos) and visit Me2Roo online here to see their entire collection.\n*Always be sure to consult your physician before beginning any exercise program*\n\nWant more workouts and info for working out during pregnancy and after baby check out the Knocked-Up Fitness Digital Prenatal Program.\n\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, After Baby, Cardio, Core, Erica Ziel, exercise modifications, Exercise Video, Fitness, healthy pregnancy, knocked-up fitness, Legs, Maternity Wear, me2roo, Pilates, postnatal fitness, pregnancy yoga, Prenatal Fitness, prenatal yoga, Weight Loss, Workout, workout video, Yoga, yoga fit workoutShare:"
