"Swimming during pregnancy can be fantastic for your body and help you feel\ngreat. If you’re cleared for exercise, here are three reasons why you’ll love\ngetting to the beach or the pool during your pregnancy.\n\n1) Swimming can help reduce aches and pains. Since swimming is a low\nimpact activity, it can really help alleviate strain on joints and muscles. You’ll\nalso be buoyant in the water, so you can take a break from any extra\npregnancy weight or swelling and feel weightless.\n2) It’s an amazing exercise! As a cardio activity, you can get your heart rate\nup while swimming laps, treading water, or even doing gentle on-the-spot\njogging in the shallow end– and since water provides some resistance, you’ll\nbe working you’re muscles too! Its also a safe exercise to perform during\nmost stages of pregnancy since you’re in the water and won’t risk tripping or\nfalling.\n3) You can make it family time– or ‘me’ time. Enjoy some time in the water\nwith your other little ones, your partner, or some time just to yourself. When\nbaby is here you’ll probably be busy– so you’ll be happy you spent some\nquality time relaxing and enjoying the water!\nPlease keep in mind you should always listen to your body and are never\nuncomfortable or struggling through an exercise. Always follow swimming\nregulations and check for a lifeguard, especially if you are new to swimming.\nIt’s also easy to forget to stay hydrated when you’re in the water, so make\nsure you’re drinking an appropriate amount of fluid for the time you spend\nexercising!\n“Swimming helped my nausea to go away with my 2nd pregnancy and have\nbeen told by other pregnant mamas it helped them as well, so it’s worth a try\nto get in the pool. You never know, you may just absolutely love it! I know I\ncouldn’t wait to get in the pool since that’s the only time that I actually didn’t\nfeel sick for a couple months during my 2nd pregnancy.” ~Erica\n \n~ Julianna\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *\nOther Related Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\nSweat Pregnant Mamas, Sweat!\n\nResistance Band Exercises\n\nCan I Run While Pregnant?\n\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, baby, Erica Ziel, exercise, exercise fitness workout, exercise for pregnant women, exercise modification, exercise modifications, Exercise Video, exercising while pregnant, first trimester pregnancy, Fitness, fitness and exercise, fitness while pregnant, health and fitness articles, healthy pregnancy, Julianna, knocked-up fitness, labor, Pilates, Postpartum, pregnancy, pregnancy complications, pregnancy fitness, pregnancy health, pregnancy workouts, pregnant, pregnant women, prenatal care, prenatal exercise, Prenatal Fitness, prenatal health, prenatal workouts, Real moms, Real talk, running, safe exercises during pregnancy, stages of pregnancy, symptoms during pregnancy, week-by-week pregnancyShare:"
