"Did you ever wish that *someday* you would get feeling back around the incision from your C-section?\n\n\n\nI know the thought has had to come to your mind on more than one occasion as you don’t want that numbness to be your normal…\n\n\n\nThis topic gets me soooo excited to talk about because of the lack of awareness around it.\n\n\n\n>>No matter how long it’s been since you’ve had a C-section, you can work to wake up your lower abdominals.<<\n\n\n\nBecause of fascia, you have the ability to tap into your scar tissue and teach your body how to move correctly so you can create stronger fascial connections in your deep core.\n\n\n\nThis is what’s so fascinating about the body and why I’m a firm believer that no matter what’s going on, you have the power to change it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery single woman that I’ve ever worked with, whether in person or online, that has learned my techniques gets the feeling back in her abdomen.\n\n\n\nKeep reading to learn how to wake up your abs so you can begin to see your body’s potential.\n\n\n\nHow to Wake Up Your Abs After a C-Section:\n\n\n\n1. Breath\n\n\n\nBy learning how to lightly connect with your deep core and pelvic floor through breathwork, you will begin to tap into the deeper fascial layers in the front of the abdominal wall.\n\n\n\n2. Pelvic Tilts\n\n\n\nThis simple and gentle move is at the foundation of all my teachings. Using your breath to tilt your pelvis can allow you to reconnect with your body in a whole new way.\n\n\n\n3. Give Yourself Grace\n\n\n\nRemind yourself that when you start implementing my training techniques, that it’s normal not to feel anything at first. It’s part of the journey for you to  become stronger, minimize and prevent dysfunction, and get your confidence back.\n\n\n\nI hope this helped give you hope at seeing what’s possible for your body!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more healing techniques like this one, download my FREE Pelvic Floor Guide.
