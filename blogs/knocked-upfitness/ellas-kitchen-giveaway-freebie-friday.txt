"I love Ellaâ€™s Kitchenorganic baby food pouches. What do I love most about them..\nâ€œThey contain nothing, absolutely nothing, but pureed organic fruits and vegetablesâ€œ. How awesome is that!\nMy 21 month old son loves them too (his fav is the purple one)! He devours them & goes for more. Yes I know heâ€™s not a baby anymore but if he will eat fruits & veggies pureed in a pouch then I am sold & will buy more!  Who said kids have to eat their broccoli in broccoli form? Not me!\nIâ€™m giving away 4 free coupons for  Ellasâ€™ Kitchen Baby Food Pouches!\nYou must check out their site, I love the dancing food pouches ðŸ™‚\nFind a location near you\nTo Enter:\n\nSubscribe via Email\nFollow Knocked-Up Fitness  on Twitter\nLike Knocked-Up Fitness on Facebook\nFollow @EllasKitchen on Twitter\nLike Ellas Kitchen on Facebook\nTell me why you want Ellaâ€™s Kitchen Organic Food Pouches for your little one or soon to be little one ðŸ™‚\nHave your little one(s) tried them?
