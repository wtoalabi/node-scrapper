"During Pregnancy & After Baby Always Listen to Your Body\n \nThis is the BEST advice anyone could give a pregnant momma!\nI teach my clients to connect with the right muscles (not just going through the motions) when working out, it makes every exercise more effective, plus it helps women become more in-tune with their bodies. This is not only advice for pregnant mommas out there, but for all women; we usually have an “intuition” or “gut feeling” of when something is off or just not right. Common sense needs to play a role too, but as a mom myself we tend to just push ourselves because we have so much to do in our crazy busy lives of work, kids, hubby, & life!\nTake care of yourself & you WILL be a better mom. A happy healthy mom makes for a better one 🙂\nRest Up & Keep It Moving Mommas!\nE\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, Advice, After Baby, best advice, body, clients, effectiveness, Erica Ziel, exercise, fit, Fitness, health, healthy pregnancy, knocked-up fitness, listen to your body, pregnancy, pregnancy advice, pregnancy fitness, pregnancy tips, Prenatal Fitness, Q & A, running during pregnancy, safety, stay, tips, week-by-week pregnancy, womenShare:"
