It’s important to avoid over-stretching because relaxin causes your body to become more flexible during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nRemember mama, I said that you’re in the right place, so let me tell you about the best (and safe!) pregnancy stretches for your hips.\n\n\n\nMermaid Stretch\n\n\n\n*Look at this stretch, isn’t it neat?*\n\n\n\nOkay…enough of the Little Mermaid and let’s get to talking about why I LOVE this stretch.\n\n\n\nYou’re able to:\n\n\n\nStay lightly connected through your core.Activate your glutes and hamstrings to support your belly.Create length and opposition through your body.\n\n\n\nThis is a great way to feel a lateral opening of the hips to release any tension that might be there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHip Rolls\n\n\n\nThis is a staple movement that you will find in allllll of my programs. Hip rolls allow you to connect through your pelvis while taking the pressure off of your pelvic floor.\n\n\n\n>>Having your hips up is a safe position to be in during pregnancy, but always consult with your doctor to make sure it’s okay for you to lay on your back.<<\n\n\n\nTake your time through this movement to find mobility along your spine because that is what makes hip rolls one of the best pregnancy stretches for your hips.\n\n\n\nStanding Cat Cows\n\n\n\nWarning: you will find yourself doing this movement any chance you get during pregnancy AND well after.\n\n\n\nDoing cat cows with a chair allows you to create space along your spine while feeling connected and supported with your bump.\n\n\n\nNot only can this movement release your hips, but it can also alleviate any neck tension that you might be carrying with you throughout your day.\n\n\n\nOkay mama, ready to release those hips?
