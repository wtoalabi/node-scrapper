"As a prenatal and postnatal exercise specialist, I love teaching women our unique ways of training the female bodyâ€¦but after working with all types of women before, during and after their pregnancies, I know that moving your body this way is something that youâ€™ve never experienced before.\n\n\n\nEspecially while youâ€™re BUMPINâ€™. Like how do you maneuver around with this thing!\n\n\n\n>>But as a prenatal exercise specialist and certified doula, Iâ€™ve discovered that you have to adjust your workouts for what stage of pregnancy youâ€™re in.<<\n\n\n\nTo help you get moving in your second trimester, here are 4 effective movements to add to your routineâ€¦\n\n\n\n*But no bump required to feel the benefits of these moves ðŸ˜‰\n\n\n\n1. Upper Back and Shoulder Release\n\n\n\nFor this move, youâ€™re going to want to grab your exercise band to feel a wrapping around your shoulder blades. When doing this shoulder release, you donâ€™t want to go so far back that you lose your deep core connection because then it will go right into your low back! Round your spine a little as you come forward to feel the tension in your upper back release.\n\n\n\n2. Childâ€™s Pose Release\n\n\n\nAlthough this pose seems straight forward, the key to childâ€™s pose is to keep length along your sacrum. Donâ€™t tuck your pelvisâ€¦you want to be in a comfortable position where you feel space between your hip bones and deep in the pelvis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Assisted Hip Opener\n\n\n\nThis is probably one of my favorite moves because it allows you to really release and relax through your hips. When in this position, you want to make sure you are connected through your core as you breathe deep into your back. *There should be some amazing opposition through your body going on here!*\n\n\n\n4. Lateral Lunge Pulse\n\n\n\nQuite possibly the trickiest move on the list to feel those right connections. You want to always focus on having a lengthened posture as you feel wrapping around your front glute.\n\n\n\nThere you have it, mama! Four effective exercises for your second trimester that will strengthen your deep core and create space in your body.\n\n\n\nTo see these moves in action, check out >>this video!<<\n\n\n\nFor more pregnancy moves, we have just the thing for you: aÂ free workoutÂ where Erica takes you through bump approved moves for any stage of your pregnancy.\n\n\n\nThis FREE workout will give you some insight on how we train the beautiful women in our Knocked-Up Fitness Prenatal membership to help prepare their bodies for birth, have a speedier deliveryÂ and an easier recovery postpartum!\n\n\n\nIf youâ€™re ready to feel empowered during your pregnancy, grab your free Pregnancy WorkoutÂ and get ready to feel strong and confident with your growing bump!\n\n\nPages: Page 1, Page 2Tags: pregnancy exercises at home, second trimester exercises, second trimester pregnancy routine, second trimester workout routine, staying fit during pregnancy, staying fit during second trimesterShare:"
