"I can’t tell you how often I get asked… “How soon can I workout now that I’ve had my baby?”\nWatch my video below for my detailed answer to this…\n\n \n \nNow that you’ve had your little one(s) and understand how soon you can workout again after baby, the Functional Pilates-Infused Workouts and healthy meal planning are designed for you to get your body back!\nWith gradual (yet challenging) progressional workouts that’ll leave you feeling sore in all the right places the next day, plus diastasis recti is addressed and included are a couple short videos discussing those first steps towards getting your abs back after baby. Because, yes, crunches can make diastasis worse (or I should say “will” make worse). And of course the healthy meal planning and recipes can give you the kickstart you need!\n\nYou must work your middle slowly and gradually strengthen, especially if this is baby #2 or beyond for you. Taking care of yourself is the first step to being the best mom you can be! I know it’s challenging and you may feel like you have no time to workout but take even just 10 minutes (or more if you can) most days of the week to feel (and look) your best! You deserve it mama!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: After Baby, Core, Diastasis Recti, Erica Ziel, Fitness, Getting my body back, Getting Your Abs Back, healthy pregnancy, how soon can i workout after baby, knocked-up fitness, Legs, lose the baby weight, Pilates, Postnatal, postnatal fitness, postnatal workouts, Postpartum, postpartum weight loss, pregnancy, Weight LossShare:"
