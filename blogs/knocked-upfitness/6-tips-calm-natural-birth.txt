"As a Birth Doula, I have learned that childbirth experiences can vary greatly from Mom to Mom – all depending on how they view it going in, and how they prepare for the birth. Some mothers do not see the need for trying the natural birth route and that’s TOTALLY OK! Each mom and pregnancy is just as individual as the birthing experience itself.\n\n\t\t\n\t\nIf you are a Mama looking for a more natural birthing experience I can help!\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHere are my Top 6 Tips for a Calm and Natural Birth:\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGet a Doula!\nIf you don’t get anything else from this post, please take this away – DOULAS ROCK! The concept can be hard to explain, especially to your birthing partner. Some partners can feel as if the Doula is going to over-shadow their role, and though it is totally understandable, it’s not true.\nYour Doula is there to guide you and your partner through the birth, assist in providing comfort measures, and making sure you stay on your birth plan. They can be as hands-on or off as you like, and for the most part, are very easily adaptable to your environment. Doulas can also be expensive but there are other options. Try a volunteer Doula looking for experience, resources such as Findadoula.com and Doulamatch.com are both great.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMake a Birth Plan.\nIf you do find a Doula, she can help big time with this step. A birth plan is a play by play of how you and your partner see your birth going down.\n\nDo you want to labor at home?\nDo you want a natural birth, and what does that look like for you?\nWhich essential oils will you be using?\nWho should be in the birthing room?\nWhat music should be playing?\nDo you want an epidural?\nEpisiotomy?\nWhich newborn protocols should the nurses and doctors perform?\n\nThese are all questions that should be answered on your Birth Plan. I personally am using a visual Birth Plan from Mamanatural.com; It is a little easier for non-Birth Industry folks to decipher and takes less of your nurse’s time to check over when you arrive. Once you have got your birth plan down, go over it and practice for the big day with your partner so you feel ready!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nMake Preparations.\nThis one is often overlooked but is so crucial to a stress-free birth. Along with your birthing bag and snacks, (we’ll go over this don’t worry) make sure all of the other aspects of day to day life are taken care of for at least 48 hours. Plan child care for the new baby’s siblings, board or get a house sitter for your pets, have a neighbor get the mail, etc. The last thing you want to be thinking about in the birthing room is if you remembered to feed the dog!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAdjust the Lighting and Set the Mood.\nWhether you’re at home or in the hospital, you’ll want to customize your environment as much as possible. Bright lights and the smell of antiseptic don’t necessarily scream, relaxing…\nDim the lights and bring a portable oil diffuser along to make those small changes. I love mine from Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Be sure to smell each oil you plan on packing before the big day as your preferences may change with pregnancy.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSnack for Success.\nMost hospitals will allow you to bring and eat food throughout the birth (ask at your hospital tour). Which snacks you bring can make a big difference. Packing your cooler full of high carb, sugary, processed foods can really deplete your energy levels and eventually your birth. Some of my favorite birthing snacks include:\n\nCarrots + Hummus\nNuts\nPeanut Butter + Celery\nApples\nOrganic Raisins\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGet a Move On!\nDuring contractions or, waves, staying still in a bed is not the best idea. If you aren’t on an IV drip and your providers allow it – get up!\n\nSquat\nWalk\nDance!\nBend over a table and sway your hips\n\nMoving is one of your best and most effective tools for managing discomfort and helping baby along his way down. Utilizing different positions can be an effective way to achieve a natural birth.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThere you have it! Six tips to get you through your natural birth!
