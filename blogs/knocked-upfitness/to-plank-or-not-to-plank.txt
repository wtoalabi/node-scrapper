"I get asked this question all the time, are planks safe during pregnancy? Can I do planks with diastasis recti? So to plank or not to plank, is a very big question especially if we are discussing diastasis recti.\n\nFirst, I LOVE planks!\nSecond, you must know when your body is ready to do planks, during pregnancy, postpartum or anytime really…\n \nHere are some easy guidelines to follow:\n\nDo you have diastasis recti? (if you aren’t sure read this) Having diastasis recti isn’t an automatic “no” (unless you’re pregnant and have diastasis), it’s a “maybe”. It really depends on your answers to the next 3 questions and be sure to read this entire post too.\nCan you connect your deep core muscles? (not sure what they are check out this post) You must be able to have at least a light deep core connection.\nDo you see any “coning” of your belly? You must avoid this or you may be causing more damage to your abdominals and even low back. I talk much more about coning of your belly and specifically ‘how to’ strengthen your deep core in my Knocked-Up Fitness Membership.\nCan you feel your abdominals connect near your ribcage and your lower abdominal area? If all you feel is pain in your low back then you need to do other simpler exercises for now and give your body more time.\n\n\nYes you can feel confident and sexy during pregnancy and again postpartum! \nAbsolutely, don’t let anyone {or yourself} tell you otherwise! Mama you got this and I’m here to accompany you on your amazing incredible journey through pregnancy! Join me today in my Knocked-Up Fitness Membership!\n\n\n\nPLANK SLIDES\nHere is my favorite plank exercise “Plank Slides”. I do love these and teach these to a lot of clients, even my clients with diastasis recti (you just gasped – I know!) but let me tell you why. For starters I would never recommend doing these plank slides in those first sessions postpartum (diastasis or not), you really do need to allow your body time to heal and regain some pelvic floor and deep core strength. However I love, love, love these for strengthening those deep core muscles once your body is ready. \nThat is the KEY to planks, your body must be ready… and I recommend starting with plank slides over holding a static plank. I find moving in the plank position to be a very effective deep core exercise and great for getting those abs back, but you must be ready. There are so many great exercises you can be doing until then…\n*Always be sure your physician has cleared you to exercise before beginning any exercise programs*\n\n\nBegin in a full plank position on forearms and toes. Press legs together to help engage your pelvic floor (do a kegel), transverse abdominals (think lower belly) and intercostals (think “ribs) while also pulling up on the quads (your thighs).\nExhale while moving your body forward staying in a plank position.\nInhale while moving your body back. (Focus on stretching the calves in the backward movement).\nModify: Switch out any plank exercises for a modified plank on forearms and knees or stick with those easier exercises mentioned above until your body is ready.\n\n \nWatch for any bulging of your abdominals while in a plank position, note the difference in extra lose skin hanging vs. a good flat fascial/muscle connection across your lower belly. The extra skin is inevitable and will decrease will time, just be sure that if you notice any of your abdominal area hanging towards that ground that it is in deed skin and not your abdominals bulging towards the ground.\nReady to learn more? Begin your Prenatal and Postnatal Exercise Specialist Course + Certification.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBe sure to follow those guidelines above to determine if planks are right for you right now. And if your body isn’t ready today it’s not a forever “no” it’s just a “not ready yet” but “someday”. So hang in there and keep strengthening those deep core muscles with more appropriate pregnancy and after baby and busy mom exercises, workouts and programs.\nOne lasting thing: Please share this article with your girlfriends. I’ve talked with so many mom’s after pregnancy who had been doing exercises they later learned they should have skipped. While some women can safely do planks their entire pregnancy some should skip those and do easier core exercises as listed above. Exercise during pregnancy has so many wonderful benefits but being educated on what exercises are best, specifically core exercises can make a big impact on women during their years of having babies and beyond.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: Abdominal Exercise, abs exercises, Core, deep core, Diastasis Recti, exercise, exercise modifications, Pilates, Plank, plank slides, planks, Postnatal Exercise, Prenatal Fitness, prenatal instructor, prenatal training, to plank or not to plank, YogaShare:"
