"Chances are you know that once you’re pregnant, maintaining a safe exercise routine is ideal for baby (see Sweat, Pregnant Mamas Sweat). But what you might not know is that your pre-pregnancy fitness routine plays an important role in getting pregnant & your pregnancy health. Here’s how finding your fitness niche can help you have a happy, healthy pregnancy!\n\nBefore Getting Pregnant:\n1) Your pre-pregnancy body might not be the #1 thing on your mind when you’re trying to get pregnant, after all, chances are your physical appearance will change during pregnancy anyways. While you shouldn’t stress too much about the number on the scale, your pre-pregnancy weight can affect your ability to conceive. Being within a healthy weight range can boost your ability to conceive, while being significantly overweight or underweight can make it up to four times more difficult to conceive. Shoot for your ideal weight range, and achieve it the healthy way– no crash dieting!\n \n2) Don’t overdo it! You’ve probably heard that being overweight can affect hormones, but what you might not know is that over training can affect your ability to conceive, too. So if you’re serious about getting pregnant, gradually switch to some pregnancy-friendly exercises and make sure your diet includes enough nutrients to support reproductive health.\n \n3) Checking up on your health and overhauling bad habits can have other benefits, too. Many natural health practitioners suggest healthy detoxifying for up to a year before conceiving, to reduce the amount of toxins present in the body during early pregnancy. This is the time to kick bad habits, like quitting smoking ASAP! The same goes for your diet and health– studies show that a healthy maternal weight, combined with a healthful diet and exercise can have a positive impact on your baby’s health throughout their life!\n \n4) Taking your prenatal supplements including a prenatal vitamin, folic acid, and DHA, in the months before you try to conceive points to a healthier pregnancy and baby. Since most women won’t know they are pregnant until at least 2-3 weeks along (for others, longer) it is recommended that all women take pregnancy supporting supplements before trying to conceive, to ensure the benefits are their for baby as soon as you conceive.\n \nWhen Trying to Conceive:\n5) Maintain a fitness routine that will be safe to continue during pregnancy. Since you probably won’t know the exact moment you get pregnant, choose exercises that are low impact, no-contact, and can easily be modified with your growing belly.\n \n6) Reduce your stress. Easier said than done, but remember– stress can negatively impact your hormones and make conceiving more difficult. Whether it’s stress at work, or stress about trying to conceive, remember to take time to relax and recharge, it will greatly benefit you both physically and mentally (we promise!).\n \n7) Stock your fridge with pregnancy friendly, nutritious foods. Even though you aren’t eating for two, it’s important to make nutritious diet decisions to keep your body stocked with the nutrients your baby will need. Remember fish is a great source of essential fats, but limit your intake and be sure you’re eating wild caught varieties that aren’t high in mercury. And try to limit caffeine– some studies have shown a correlation between high caffeine intake and fertility issues.\nJulianna\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *\nOther Related Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\nKnocked-Up Fitness Prenatal Fitness Program\n7 Pregnancy Super Foods\n6 Overlooked Early Pregnancy Signs & Symptoms\n\nAlways Listen To Your Body!\n\n\n \nSources:\nWebMD\nParents.com\nBabyCenter.com\nTags: conception, Erica Ziel, exercise, Fitness, getting pregnant, health, healthy pregnancy, Julianna, knocked-up fitness, Nutrition, pregnancy, pregnancy fitness, pregnancy health, pregnant, pregnant women, stages of pregnancy, trying to conceive, week-by-week pregnancyShare:"
