"Mama, do you want to naturally improve your digestion?\n\n\n\n*I got you.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally improve digestion by calming down the inflammation!\n\n\n\nThis is the simplest way to get your gut moving. It takes pressure and stress off of your body, core, and pelvic floor.\n\n\n\nDigestion is intertwined with improving deep core function. It’s not something that we initially think has a correlation *but it does*.\n\n\n\n>>That’s why I’ve included a whole course on digestive health inside Core Rehab because it takes more than movement to heal the body.<<\n\n\n\n*Isn’t it crazy how that works?*\n\n\n\nEverything in the body is connected.\n\n\n\nOkay, Erica, back to talking about ways to naturally improve digestion.\n\n\n\nHere are four simple things that you can start implementing into your daily life today:\n\n\n\nCut out inflammatory foods (gluten, dairy, corn, processed foods, fried food)Improve body’s ability to break down food (slowing down when you eat and chewing well, minimizing liquids during meals, taking bitters before you eat, reducing stress)Get rid of bad pathogensTruely heal the gut (adding in good quality fats, proteins, vitamin C, Omegas, collagen)\n\n\n\nSo to anyone who feels like there’s no way you can cut out certain foods or add in supplements, only you have the power to improve the way you feel.\n\n\n\nAs you start making small changes, it will have a chain reaction as you start to discover more about your body.\n\n\n\nYou can improve anything about your health that you put your mind to when you believe that you can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re ready to do big things together, I’d be honored if you joined me for my upcoming free class, The Pelvic Floor’s Role In Healing Your Body. In it, you’ll learn how to improve your pelvic floor function by understanding how the body works as a whole.
