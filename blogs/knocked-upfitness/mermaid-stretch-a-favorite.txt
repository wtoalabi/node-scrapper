"I LOVED this stretch when I was pregnant!  Wait I take that back, I still LOVE the mermaid stretch & so do my clients.\nYou can also do it without the band, it feels soooo good to open up the front of your hips which can get really tight during pregnancy. Breath into your hips & belly to feel a great hip flexor & psoas stretch too!\nA great stretch for all you runners.
