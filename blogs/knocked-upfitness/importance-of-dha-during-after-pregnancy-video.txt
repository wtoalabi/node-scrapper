"I came across this video the other day and had totally forgotten about ever filming it (over 2 years ago that is!). I was very pregnant â€“ like 40 weeks pregnant â€“ with baby #3! You can have a good laugh with me â€“ so funny to see yourself that pregnant (big boobs and all!). Now back to what this is all about:\nI was just discussing this with a client the other day and it comes up often: supplements during pregnancy. This is (in my opinion, I am not a doctor and with that said, always discuss with your doctor first) the most important supplement you should always take, pregnant or not! Feel free to watch my rambling about cod liver oilâ€“ which I used to take religiously during all 3 of my pregnancies. I do still take cod lover oil but have since switched to Green Pastures Fermented Cold Liver capsules. You could use Carlsonâ€™s Norwegian cold liver oil, which is good, but Green Pastureâ€™s is higher quality.\n\nHereâ€™s what you need to look for when buying fish oil:\n\nIt must be higher in DHA than EPA â€“ the DHA is what can really help with brain function and development (and inflammation, but thatâ€™s another topic all itâ€™s own!!)\nCod Liver is one of the best sources.\nMost standard recommendations state around 400 mg, however, Iâ€™ve read enough research that recommends at least 1,000mg during and after pregnancy. Since baby is growing and developing rapidly and baby will take from you everything they need, you are the one left depleted.\n\nPossible benefits of taking Cod Liver Oil (DHA):\n\nIncrease babyâ€™s brain development and function \nDecrease your chances of postpartum depression\nBetter brain function for you!\nDecreased inflammation (the root of all diseases!)\n\nBe sure you continue to take your supplements while you breastfeed and beyond, forever and ever and everâ€¦.\nDonâ€™t wait any longer, itâ€™s never to late to start taking DHA!\n~Erica\nP.S. Iâ€™m not getting paid or making any money by promoting these companiesâ€“ this one is just for my Mommas from me ðŸ™‚\nÂ \nSources:\nGreenPasture\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, After Baby, baby, Baby Development, cod liver oil, DHA, Favorites, fish oil, Green Pastures, health care during pregnancy, Healthy Lifestyle, healthy nutrition for pregnant women, healthy pregnancy, Omega-3, Postpartum, Postpartum depression, postpregnancy, Pregnancy Aches, pregnancy health, Pregnancy Information, pregnancy tips, products, Real talk, stages of pregnancy, symptoms during pregnancyShare:"
