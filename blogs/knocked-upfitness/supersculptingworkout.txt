"Spring into Summer Series with Knocked-Up Fitness and Me2Roo. Hopefully you felt the burn last week with the Fitness Fusion Workout. Here is your next video, the Super Sculpting Workout, designed for you during pregnancy, after baby, and beyond! Be sure to follow the modifications if you are in your 2nd or 3rd trimester and right after baby, or if you just arenâ€™t ready to do the full version. Check out the image below the video for pictures of all the exercises.  Keep sharing with your friends! I highly recommend Me2Roo Maternity and Lifestyle wear (check them out in the videos) and visit Me2Roo online here to see their entire collection. \n*Always be sure to consult your physician before beginning any exercise program*\n\nWant more workouts and info for working out during pregnancy and after baby check out the Knocked-Up Fitness Prenatal, After Baby and Busy Mom Programs.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, After Baby, Cardio, Core, Erica Ziel, Exercise Video, Fitness, free workout, knocked-up fitness, lose the baby weight, Maternity Wear, me2roo, Pilates, postnatal fitness, Postpartum, pregnancy, pregnancy exercise, pregnancy workouts, prenatal exercise, products, super sculpting workout, Weight Loss, Workout, workout video, YogaShare:"
