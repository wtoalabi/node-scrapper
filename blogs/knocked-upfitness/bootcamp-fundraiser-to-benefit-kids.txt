Hope you have a tissue nearby, you will need it…\n\n \nHere is an exert from Jen’s post about the Maddie James Foundation: “On a Friday afternoon just two months ago in January, Maddie was in her kindergarten class playing with friends and two days later, on that Sunday morning, she was diagnosed with a malignant, inoperable brain tumor and given 6 months.  Survival rate for this type of cancer? 0%.” read more…\nEvery time I even think about her it bring tears…. Having a 4 year old little girl & 2 year old little boy  I can’t even begin to image what life without one of them would be like.
