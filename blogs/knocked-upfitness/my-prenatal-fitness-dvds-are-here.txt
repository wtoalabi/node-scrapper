"I’m super excited to announce that my Prenatal Fitness DVD’s are here & available on Amazon!\nCheck out my new logo, homepage, & updated website!\n\nBesides being great workouts during pregnancy, they are also great for after baby! It’s a good idea after baby to start where you left off working out before delivery.\nEnjoy!\n~Erica\nTags: After Baby, Baby Bump, Erica Ziel, exercise, Fitness, knocked-up fitness, Maternity, Pilates, Postpartum, pregnancy, pregnancy exercise, Prenatal Fitness DVD's, YogaShare:"
