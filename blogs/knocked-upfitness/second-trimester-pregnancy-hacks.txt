"Baby boy bump and I have finally made it out of the second trimester — to 28 weeks! For me, this is the mark of my third trimester. What got me through my 1st trimester was focusing on staying healthy and feeling well during my queasy days. However, my 2nd trimester has been extremely pleasant and all about getting prepared!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*Staying on Track with my Knocked-Up Fitness Prenatal Videos*\nThe last 3 months, being in my second trimester, have had me feeling extremely strong when it comes to working out! So much so, that I have been able to get into the gym five to six times a week. Being a Prenatal Fitness Trainer I tend to follow my Knocked-Up Fitness videos and write my own workouts following a full body 1-hour plan. This routine has helped me avoid hip, back, and joint pain almost altogether. It has also really helped me maintain my weight gain (ladies in my family have gained between 40 and 60 pounds per pregnancy) to about 2 to 4 pounds each month. Get yours HERE.\n*Regular Chiropractic Adjustments*\nStarting at about 22 weeks I began to see a chiropractor I really trust every other week. There are a ton of benefits to this practice that I have seen first hand in my Training and Doula clients. The APA lists some of those; keeping loose joins aligned, relieving joint pain, preventing a breech baby, reduced labor time, and preventing C-section. While I have been able to avoid much pain at all due to staying active, my second-trimester self-care routine really makes me feel productive! Make sure and find a CERTIFIED PRENATAL CHIROPRACTOR! Find one via the link above.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t*Swelling Prevention and Hacks*\nOkay, ladies, I have heard gripes about pregnancy swelling for the last six years from my clients, friends, and sister and let me tell you… they were not lying! Like clockwork in my second trimester, I woke up on my 26th week feeling like the Michelin Man. Your amniotic fluid is at it’s peak on the 28th week so this is totally normal but none the less uncomfortable. So I have been relying on Turmeric Spice* in my water, and Lemon Essential Oil and Grapefruit Essential Oil in my bath to keep the swelling at bay.\nFor the water, all I do is add 3 dashes of Turmeric Spice* and a squeeze of lemon in my first water of the day. This really helps reduce inflammation around the joins and gets me moving much easier.\n*Take note: only use as much spice as you would to season food. For breastfeeding Mamas, gradually increase from 1 dash to 3 as it could have a drying effect on your milk.\nFor the bath, I add 1 or 2 drops each of the Lemon and Grapefruit Oils with Epson salts, and almond oil to a lukewarm bath. Soak for about 30 min. When I get out, I feel like a new woman!\n*Combating Pregnancy Mask*\nAlright, so this one is my favorite weird second-trimester preggo find. I’ve known I’d get some new spots during pregnancy because my skin reacts to the sun very easily. What I have found works the best at lightening pregnancy mask, or melasma is Milk of Magnesia! I use THIS. All you do is apply some to a cotton round, and wipe it on like a toner. I keep mine on overnight and wake up with lighter spots every time. It takes about 2 weeks to see a change, but be patient and you can avoid chemical alternatives.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nI hope these help all my mamas out there.
