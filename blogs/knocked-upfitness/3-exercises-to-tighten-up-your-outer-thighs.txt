"I love these side lying lateral exercises for any stage of life!\nEspecially great during pregnancy as you can easily do them comfortably on your side, plus after baby when youâ€™re ready to tone up those outer thighs!\nCombine all 3 exercises together for a burn you are sure to feel!\nStart with 10-20 reps of each exercise then move onto the next, aiming to do 20-30 reps of each exercise. Then switch to your other side. Feel free to repeat this series on each side as many times as you like!\n===>Now Available: The Knocked-Up Fitness Pregnancy Program\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for the Knocked-Up Fitness Newsletter to receive your FREE Booty Sculpting Workout!\n\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, After Baby, Butt, exercise, Legs, prenatal exercise, ThighsShare:"
