"Kegel Exercises are an important part of pelvic strength during pregnancy and after baby. A strong pelvic floor not only contributes to easier labor and reduced pain during pregnancy– but it can contribute to many other aspects of your life (better sex, less risk of incontinence, and a tighter abdomen… need I say more?)!\n\nOften there is concern that kegels, while doing their job to tighten ‘down there’, can increase your risk of experiencing tearing or a difficult labor– but an Obstetrics and Gynecological study on the effect of antenatal pelvic floor muscle training on labor and birth proves otherwise! Women who performed regular pelvic floor muscle training exercises were actually less likely to experience tearing during labor. Additionally, the study showed that women performing these exercises had a reduced rate of necessary episiotomy, vaccuum and forcep intervention, and cesarean delivery! All in favor of fewer complications– say I!!\nIn short, pelvic floor muscle training during pregnancy can make your delivery and after baby experience much more comfortable! To get started on pelvic floor training, check out how to perform a kegel, and The Knocked-Up Fitness Guide to Pregnancy Book, these will help you target the muscles that contribute to your pelvic floor! A strong pelvic floor is an essential part of the Prenatal and After-Baby Knocked-Up Fitness Program, because making your delivery, recovery, and long term fitness goals easier, accessible, and straightforward is what the program is all about!\nJulianna\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *\nOther Related Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\nBigger Postpartum Challenges!\n\nAfter Baby: Retraining Your Core with Kegels\nA New Way to Do Kegels\n\n \nSources:\nPubMed\nTags: After Baby, After Baby Programs, Core, Erica Ziel, exercise, Julianna, Kegels, knocked-up fitness, Postpartum, Postpartum Fitness, postpartum weight loss, pregnancy, pregnancy fitness, prenatal exercise, prenatal health, Weight LossShare:"
