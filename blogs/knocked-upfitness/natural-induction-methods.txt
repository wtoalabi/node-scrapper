"Is There A Way To Jump Start My Labor Process?\n\n\n\nAs we enter those last weeks of pregnancy, it is completely natural to start researching different natural induction methods to help get the labor + delivery show on the road.\n\nWhat are some natural induction methods?\nSome of the most common methods include:\n\nPrenatal Massage\nReflexology\nAcupuncture\nExercise\nSpicy Foods\nEssential Oils\nMembrane Stripping\n\nDo these natural methods work?\nSometimes. Most of the methods listed above will not jump-start your labor until your body is actually ready.  If one or more of these methods does happen to get things moving, then great! But I do caution you that using these methods before your body is ready, can sometimes lead to unwanted interventions down the road.\nIf I did want to try one or more of these natural methods, when is a good time to begin?\n\nIf you are 39-41 weeks pregnant and have already started to see signs of labor such as loss of mucus plug or patterned contractions then you could begin trying one or more of these natural induction methods.\nIf you are having a bigger baby and your OB or Midwife has suggested natural induction methods to help get your labor started.\nIf you are over-due and need a happy distraction from all the waiting!\n\nIs it ok to wait until my body naturally goes into labor?\nAbsolutely! Your body has known exactly what to do up until this point. When it’s ready to start the labor process, it will get things moving. In the meantime, I highly recommend you enjoy those last few weeks or days with your partner and/or get some much needed rest + relaxation!\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: 3rd Trimester, baby birth delivery, induced, knocked-up fitness, labor, labor and delivery, options for being induced, pregnancy health, prenatal health, Real talk, stages of pregnancy, Vaginal DeliveryShare:"
