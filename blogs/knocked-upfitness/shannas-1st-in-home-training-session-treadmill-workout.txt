"(forgot to take a picture of her running – next time)\nThis mornings workout with Shanna I had her warm-up by doing 20 minutes of cardio on her treadmill, including 8 minutes of sprints. Here is the sequence I had her do:\n20 minutes @ 2.5 incline\n\n5 min warm-up @ 3.8 mph\n3 min light jog @ 4.5 mph\nSprinting begins: 20 seconds off & 40 seconds sprinting\nrest standing on the side rails for 20 seconds\nHop back on at 5.0 mph for 40 seconds\nRest 20 seconds & increase to 5.5 mph\n\nRepeat:\n\n6.0 mph 40 sec\n6.5 mph 40 sec\n7.0 mph – Shanna made it almost half way through, she hit her threshold & it was time to go back down.\n\nRest 30-60 seconds to get your breath back, then it’s back to sprinting 40 sec. & 20 sec. rest\n\n6.0 mph 40 sec.\n5.5 mph 40 sec.\n5.0 mph 40 sec.\n\nGreat Job!\nTime to cool down to finish out a 20 minute cardio session\n\n2 min @ 4.5 mph\n2 min walking @ 3.5 mph\n\nStay accountable! I’d love to hear what you have to say about this 20 minute cardio workout & what helps you stay accountable to your workouts.\n~E\n\n\n\n\nTags: After Baby, Cardio, Erica Ziel, exercise, Fitbook, Fitness, knocked-up fitness, Legs, Nutrition, OC, Pilates, postnatal fitness, pre-baby body, Real moms, Real talk, running, Treadmill workoutShare:"
