Always discuss any changes in your nutrition and supplementation with your doctor.\n\n\nIt’s important to get adequate of these important nutrients during pregnancy because baby will take from your body what baby needs for proper development. Which means, in the long run, it may be your body that could suffer if you aren’t getting proper nutrition.\nHere are 6 important nutrients for pregnancy that are recommended, plus some additional tips I always encourage with my pregnant mamas![/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text][/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=\".vc_custom_1547590790148{margin-bottom: 0px !important;}\"]Calcium\n\n\n\n \t\n\nCalcium is needed for helping to build healthy teeth, bones, muscles and heart. As a pregnant mama you need calcium to preserve your bone mass, as baby will take from your body what baby needs for proper development.\n\n\n \t\n\nPregnant women need 1000 mg of calcium daily to meet the recommended daily requirements, along with a combination of other vitamins such as Calcium and Vitamin D {more below}.\n\n\n \t\n\nIt’s optimal to get your calcium from foods such as dark leafy greens, broccoli, kale {just don’t overdue kale due to its effect it can have on thyroid function}, bok choy, figs, oranges, canned wild salmon {limit your fish intake when pregnant to 1 to 2 times per week}, almonds, and fortified foods such as cereals and milk.\n\n\n \t\n\nWhen you need additional calcium Viactiv Calcium Soft Chews are the #1 doctor-recommended calcium supplement chew, {each chew provides 500 mg of calcium and 500 IU of vitamin D} taken twice daily {at 2 different times} provides 100% of the daily recommendation for calcium.\n\n\n \t\n\nSave $2 on your next Viactiv Calcium Soft Chew with this printable coupon! You can find Viactiv Calcium Soft Chews at the following locations; Target, CVS, Rite Aid, BJs Wholesale Club, Walmart and supermarkets nationwide.\n\n\n \t\n\nI don’t mind the taste of the Viactiv Calcium Soft Chews, in my nutrition practice and professional review I would recommend them but would like to see them replace the hydrogenated oil with a healthier oil in the future.\n\n\n \t\n\n #BumpUpYourCalcium – follow Viactiv on Facebook and Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nIron\n\n\n\n \t\n\nIron is essential to help prevent anemia.\n\n\n \t\n\n27 milligrams of iron is recommended daily.\n\n\n \t\n\nIron can be found in lean red meats, poultry, fish, and iron-fortified cereals.\n\n\n \t\n\nSometimes it’s best to take an iron supplement as a stand-alone supplement rather than together with a prenatal vitamin. Be sure to discuss iron supplementation with your doctor as it’s not necessary for every pregnant woman.\n\n\n\n\n\nDHA\n\n\n\n \t\n\nDHA is important for brain development, function, inflammation and overall health including helping to prevent depression both during pregnancy and postpartum.\n\n\n \t\n\nDuring pregnancy and while nursing it’s important to include additional DHA supplementation to support what baby will take from you, your brain and body need the additional DHA as well.\n\n\n \t\n\nThe FDA, EPA and 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating 8 to 12 ounces of a variety of seafood {lower in mercury} weekly. Don’t worry if fish isn’t on your radar – you can easily supplement {and it’s something I highly recommend to all pregnant, nursing or neither}!\n\n\n \t\n\nDHA can be found in fish and supplementation, the best fish options are salmon, anchovies, herring, sardines, trout, and Atlantic and Pacific mackerel, cod,\n\n\n \t\n\nSome fish should be limited or completely avoided during pregnancy due to potential high mercury content include; swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, along with canned tuna {a small amount of canned tuna can be okay but limit to less than 6 ounces in a week}.\n\n\n \t\n\nOther food sources include flaxseeds, walnuts, sunflower seeds and edamame, along with fortified foods and DHA supplements.\n\n\n \t\n\nEven if you eat fish regularly, be sure to limit during pregnancy and read the list above of recommendations to eat and to avoid during pregnancy, it’s still a good idea to add an additional DHA supplement.\n\n\n\n\n\nFolate and Folic Acid\n\n\n\n \t\n\nFolate and folic acid are important for preventing birth defects.\n\n\n \t\n\nFolate is a B vitamin and folic acid is the synthetic form of folate.\n\n\n \t\n\n800 micrograms of folate or folic acid before conception and during pregnancy is the recommended dosage.\n\n\n \t\n\nFound in spinach, peas, beans, fortified cereals, asparagus, oranges, and peanuts. \n\n\n\n\n\nVitamin D \n\n\n\n \t\n\nVitamin D is essential for bone strength, heart health, immune function, sleep and more.\n\n\n \t\n\nInstitute of Medicine {IOM} recommends 600 IU per day of vitamin D, I’ve researched more about vitamin D and the vitamin D council actually recommends 4000 IU’s to 6000 IU’s daily during pregnancy and while nursing. That may sound like a lot, but the body needs it and more and more studies are finding that vitamin D is a crucial nutrient for so many functions of the human body.\n\n\n \t\n\nEspecially important in winter months when you may not be getting much vitamin D from the sun.\n\n\n \t\n\nThe best ways for you to get vitamin D are sun exposure and supplementation. Even with regular sun exposure adding additional supplementation may be needed as with sun exposure there are so many variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nIodine\n\n\n\n \t\n\nIodine is needed for normal brain development and growth and is essential for thyroid hormone production.\n\n\n \t\n\nIOM recommends 150-200 micrograms per day of iodine.\n\n\n \t\n\nCheck your prenatal vitamin to see if it includes iodine, if it doesn’t it’s a good idea to add. Always discuss with your doctor before.\n\n\n\n\n\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text][/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=\".vc_custom_1547590931501{margin-bottom: 0px !important;}\"]Those are some of the important nutrients for pregnancy, here are some additional tips I always encourage my pregnant mama’s to do their best with:\nSleep – Absolutely a key element to be sure you are allowing your body enough rest. Listen to your body and when it’s tired, it’s telling you to slow down and rest! There is so much going on right now and your baby and your body need to sleep.\nStaying Active –  It’s important to stay active and move your body regularly, it doesn’t have to be a full workout to have huge benefits. Going for a short walk, doing a 10-minute workout or a handful of your favorite pregnancy exercises can help you to feel more energized and lead to many of the amazing benefits of staying active. Take advantage of the days you feel more energized and squeeze in a longer workout or walk!\nHydration – Keep water with you at all times! Staying hydrated is a must, and later in pregnancy, dehydration could lead to pre-term labor or false labor. Keep in mind if you exercise regularly to up your intake!\nDe-stress – Your baby feels all the stress that you do which can impact your pregnancy. Do your best to minimize stress in your life while pregnant, maybe that means saying ‘no’ to activities from time to time, sleeping more, exercising more, eating healthier, doing things that make you feel happy, or including meditation.\nMinimizing Sugar – I know those pregnancy cravings can get the best of you, but keeping your sugar intake minimal and picking and choosing what treats you eat can help you feel better, plus the health benefits of keeping your sugar in check. Sugar can increase inflammation in your body, increase stress, decrease energy, and more!\nCalorie Intake – increasing your calorie intake to only around 300 calories per day, such as an apple + 2 tbsp. nut butter. You aren’t actually ‘eating for two’, but you do need some additional calories. Listen to your body and do your best to include good quality proteins, fats, and veggies regularly. Allowing yourself to enjoy small treats here and there, but filling up with good solid nutritious foods.\n\n\n*Please talk with your doctor before taking any supplements.
