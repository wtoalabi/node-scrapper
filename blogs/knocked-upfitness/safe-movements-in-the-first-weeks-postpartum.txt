"When you’re newly postpartum, you are told by your OB/GYN to hold off on exercise until you hit that 6-week mark.\n\n\n\nAfter working with thousands of moms and going through postpartum recovery three times myself, I soon realized that doing nothing in those first weeks postpartum could do more harm than good to your body.\n\n\n\nNow, I’m not saying to go to the gym and do a high-intensity workout…\n\n\n\n>>What I’m saying is that you can learn how to reconnect with your core and pelvic floor with the movement you are doing in your daily life.<<\n\n\n\nHere are some examples, beautiful:\n\n\n\nWhile you’re breastfeedingWhen you’re chasing after a toddler…During your time standing in the kitchen…\n\n\n\nThese are all instances where you can begin to strengthen your body.\n\n\n\nWith a little awareness of how you move and hold your body throughout your day, I can help set you up for a successful postpartum recovery.\n\n\n\n>>These are the same tools that I share with the mamas inside Core Rehab, too.<<\n\n\n\nWithout further ado, let’s get into safe movements that you can do in your first weeks postpartum!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking\n\n\n\nI am a BIG fan of starting to walk in those first days postpartum.\n\n\n\nBy no means are you going to be walking at your normal pace or distance, but this is a great way to ensure that you are getting a little bit of movement every day.\n\n\n\n>>Take this time to reconnect with your body and bond with your newborn.<<\n\n\n\nAlways remember to listen to your body so you don’t overdo it.\n\n\n\nBreathwork\n\n\n\nWhat is going to enhance your recovery postpartum is learning how to connect with your deep core through breath.\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to do a lot of movement to work your core.\n\n\n\nSit up nice and tall to inhale through your nose and guide the breath to go into the sides of your ribs. As you exhale, visualize the base of your pelvic floor lightly drawing upward through your core and out past the top of your head.\n\n\n\nAs you continue to breathe, picture your breath going deeper into your body and feel yourself getting stronger with each exhale.\n\n\n\nPosture\n\n\n\nNow that you have the breathwork down, it’s important to incorporate this practice throughout your day.\n\n\n\nAnd that starts with your posture!\n\n\n\n>>Think of working on your posture as a core exercise.<<\n\n\n\nIf you’re not aware of activating your core as you’re holding your body, you will round forward which can potentially lead to further dysfunction.\n\n\n\nBut that doesn’t have to happen…YOU have the power to change your body.\n\n\n\nGentle Movement\n\n\n\nTime to bring it all together! Breath and posture work together to enhance your gentle movement practice while waking up your deep core.\n\n\n\nOur mamas LOVE doing pelvic tilts on a small ball to massage the sacrum while using the breath to activate the pelvic floor.\n\n\n\n>>Allow your breath to rock your pelvis back and forth as you lengthen tall through the top of your head.<<\n\n\n\nThere you have it, Beautiful!\n\n\n\nWhen you begin to bring awareness and presence to your body, you will begin to change the way you feel during your postpartum recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re ready to understand your pelvic floor even more, I’d be honored if you joined me for my upcoming free class, The Pelvic Floor’s Role In Healing Your Body. In it, you’ll learn how your pelvic floor is involved in everything you do through fascia and neuroplasticity.
