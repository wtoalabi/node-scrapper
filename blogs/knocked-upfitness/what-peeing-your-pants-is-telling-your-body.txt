"Wanna know why peeing your pants should not be considered normal? \n\n\n\n*Silly question, I get it.*\n\n\n\nThe answer? There is something you can do to heal it.\n\n\n\nIt’s really common for women to experience incontinence (peeing your pants) after they’ve had a baby, YEARS after they’ve had a baby, or even if they’ve NEVER had a baby.\n\n\n\nSo, let’s talk about what you’re body is trying to tell you if you are experiencing any leakage down there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPelvic Floor Dysfunction\n\n\n\nPeeing your pants can be the first sign of pelvic floor dysfunction that could show up when you cough, sneeze, or laugh.\n\n\n\nThis is because you have no connection with your pelvic floor.\n\n\n\nYou have the choice to listen to your body and do something about it. \n\n\n\n>>It’s never too late to improve your pelvic floor function.<<\n\n\n\nThere is fascia that sits on top of the pelvic floor for holding the organs in. The cool thing about fascia is that you have the ability to create more of it, build better connections with it, and lengthen it to become stronger. All of this will allow you to improve your pelvic floor function.\n\n\n\nPelvic Organ Prolapse\n\n\n\nIf you don’t address your incontinence issues in its early stage, then it can lead into developing pelvic organ prolapsing.\n\n\n\nThat is when your organs start to fall out of your vagina – nobody wants to deal with that!\n\n\n\nIf you’re thinking this will never happen to you, think again. I hate to break it to you but the reality of it is that it happens to a lot of women and it can happen pretty young.\n\n\n\nSo it’s important to share this information with your girlfriends, your mom, and even your kids! The sooner you start to learn how to connect with your pelvic floor the sooner you are able to prevent and reverse these ailments as you age and go through life.\n\n\n\nSlow Down Exercise\n\n\n\nHigh-intensity exercise adds pressure to the pelvic floor. This could be causing you to pee your pants when you run or jump.\n\n\n\nTime and time again, women want to get right back into their before-baby exercise routines once they’ve delivered their little one.\n\n\n\nLadies, that is the worst thing that you can do for your pelvic floor.\n\n\n\nWhat I recommend is for you to take a step back from those types of workouts and create a gentle movement practice with breathwork to reconnect with your pelvic floor.\n\n\n\n>>Take your time to recovery postpartum and you will be grateful that you did!<<\n\n\n\nPelvic Floor Connection\n\n\n\nWomen are told to do Kegels to restrengthen their pelvic floor muscles BUT that is the wrong way of looking at it!\n\n\n\n1. Kegels don’t address your entire pelvic floor. They also could cause bacteria build-up (and UTI’s) if you continue to stop the flow of urine.\n\n\n\n2. There needs to be a balance between strengthening your pelvic floor and learning how to relax those muscles.\n\n\n\nMany times women have too tight of a pelvic floor which is ineffectively activating their deep core. While the pelvic floor works on its own, it optimally functions in the body as a whole. This means when addressing the pelvic floor, you also need to look at the pelvis, hips, inner thighs, etc.\n\n\n\n>>The pelvic floor is involved in everything you do.<<\n\n\n\nYou cannot properly squat, pick something up off the ground, or hold your body without using your pelvic floor.\n\n\n\nThis is why I knew I had to help women understand how the pelvic floor functions.\n\n\n\nAre you ready to do something about it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re ready to learn more, I’d be honored if you joined me for my upcoming free class, The Pelvic Floor’s Role In Healing Your Body. In it, you’ll learn how your pelvic floor is involved in everything you do while understanding fascia’s role in getting rid of pain and dysfunction for lifelong results.
