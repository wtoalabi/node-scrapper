"A few weeks ago I was covered in watermelon and waffle pieces, my son was crying because his week old balloon wasn’t floating anymore, the dog needed to be fed and let out, and my husband was calling because he forgot something he needed at work.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDoes this scene sound familiar, Mama? Mommy Burnout is described as,\n\n\t\t\n\t\n[mk_blockquote font_family=”none” animation=”left-to-right”]“the emotional and physical exhaustion that you feel from the chronic stress of parenting. It’s feeling like you’re over your kid sometimes,” by Dr. Sheryl Ziegler.[/mk_blockquote]\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBeing a Mom is extremely tiring but there is hope. You can find yourself again in the midst of all the chaos!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nSchedule Time For Yourself\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe need to stop, drop (onto the bed), and roll our thinking away from school projects and well checks. Constantly focusing on our children and families seems like the right and only option but it can lead to dangerous outcomes: social anxiety, distance in loving relationships, chronic health issues, depression and more.\nAnnie’s Anti-Burnout Tip\nSet a time each week to check in with yourself and your needs. Make a list or journal what you need to accomplish FOR YOURSELF that week in order to feel fulfilled.\n\n\t\t\n\t\nGet Rid Of The Guilt\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThis is easier said than done, but acknowledging what you need is a huge first step! Once you know that it is okay to get some work done while the baby is with a sitter or going to dinner with your partner or a friend, your body will begin to thank you!\nAnnie’s Anti-Burnout Tip\nFind a trusted person to offer some help. A sitter, nanny, family friend who can step in and help out can give you a break and a breather to help avoid mommy burnout!\n\n\t\t\n\t\nTalk It Out\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tI know that husbands and partners sometimes don’t quite understand and can take your venting as complaining. That is why a Mommy group or a good friend to unload on can make such a difference.\nAnnie’s Anti-Burnout Tip\nFind a Mommy Group via Facebook, Meetup.com, a local church or word of mouth and dive in. You might find that you have a ton in common and or have been in extremely similar situations as you.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThat is how I personally deal with the Mommy Burnout but all moms are different. So, here are some great tips from the Mamas on the Knocked-Up Fitness team:\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe power of fresh air + sunshine… Just taking a stroll around your driveway with the monitor while your baby is napping could make all the difference. I love taking my big boy outside while the little one is napping to avoid mommy burnout. We do chalk in the driveway or water the flowers and the monitor goes with me.\nOn cold days, I used to take a drive to Starbucks, turn on a podcast and take a break from being home all.the.time. When you are stuck at home, it’s hard not to look around and see all that has to be done. Every now and then, you just need some time away.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nOn Instagram, Sadie Jane was asked how she always seems happy with kids and work. She said she focuses on being in the moment with her kids because she won’t get this time back. She forgets about the to-do lists, piles of laundry, the dinner that needs to be cooked and puts her attention into being with her kiddos, interacting with them, giving them the attention, love and snuggles they are asking for.\nWhen she is PRESENT IN THE MOMENT she finds herself the happiest. But when she gets caught up in everything that needs to be done, she gets anxiety and becomes unhappy.\nI loved hearing that because that was something someone said to me early on. Forget about your to-do lists and be present with your little ones because they need you right now and you won’t get these moments back (this is obviously referring to when they are asking for your attention or wanting to be held by you).\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSometimes good enough just has to be good enough! If you bought cookies from the store for your child’s school holiday party instead of spending hours trying to replicate the ones you saw on Pinterest or your child looks like a fashion disaster because they picked out their outfit to wear for school pictures, sometimes you just have to go with it.  In life, you have to pick your battles and at the end of the day, these things really don’t matter. What matters is the love you show your family and the great memories you are building with them!\nDo something by yourself or with your kids that is relaxing. I love sitting down and putting together a big Lego set. It allows me to focus on building something from the ground up and being able to see how the structures begin to morph into something amazing as we progress through the steps. If Legos are not your thing, I also recommend coloring. Coloring is proven to relax and the brain and reduce stress and anxiety.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe material contained within is provided for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.
