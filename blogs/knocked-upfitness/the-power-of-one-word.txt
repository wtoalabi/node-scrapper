"Have you ever paused to think about the power that ONE word can have on your perspective?\n\n\n\nIt can lift your spirits, motivate you, turn your day around, ignite your passion, or even patch a broken relationship.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a single word can bring you to tears, cause heartache, leave you with mistrust, or just plain hurt you.\n\n\n\n>>But what if you used that power of one little word to create clarity, drive, passion, and to change your life?<<\n\n\n\nBack in my scrapbooking days, I followed a woman named Ali Edwards and she started a One Word exercise that encouraged people to choose a word they can focus on for the year.\n\n\n\nBefore I entered 2021, this exercise came to me and I decided I wanted to do have one for the new year.\n\n\n\nBecause after all, why not add another tool to my toolbox to propel me forward?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to bed that night with 4 different words that I couldn’t narrow down, so I slept on it to see what would come up for me in the morning.\n\n\n\nYou want to know the funniest thing…I forgot ALL 4 of my words. *hand to face!*\n\n\n\nI turned on a 5-minute breath exercise from inside the Core Rehab program before I dove into my scheduled workout to see what word would resonate with my soul.\n\n\n\nSure enough, it came to me and so much clarity opened up in my mind. \n\n\n\n>>Not only is the word itself powerful, but I can attach it to so many single words that can apply to EVERY aspect of what I want 2021 to be for me.<<\n\n\n\nThat is the power of breath and meditation.\n\n\n\nHere is my challenge to you: sit down with yourself and your breath for 5-minutes and see what word comes to you.\n\n\n\nOnce you have your word, I want you to live it and breathe it. See how different your life can be at the end of 2021 just by utilizing the power of this one word.\n\n\n\nDon’t think I’m going to tell you all of this and not share what resonated with me!\n\n\n\nMine is renewed and with it, I’m going to make 2021 my best year yet. Are you with me?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more mindset shifts like this one to apply to your movement practice, download my FREE Pelvic Floor Guide.
