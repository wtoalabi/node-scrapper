"Getting pregnant and staying pregnant affects more women than you may think. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, around 6.1 million women in the United States have difficulty becoming pregnant or staying pregnant.  \n\n\n\nBecause this is a topic that affects so many women, I invited Dr. Gleaton, a certified OBGYN and Medical Director of Natalist, to talk about all-things fertility and pregnancy-related. \n\n\n\nNobody expects to have a journey of infertility. When this happens, women oftentimes feel isolated and ashamed. Ladies…if you are struggling with getting pregnant or staying pregnant, we have a great resource for you! Natalist was created to educate women in all stages of motherhood. It is a free resource that is fact-checked and backed by science!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“No matter your journey to motherhood, we are here to support you through it. As moms and doctors, we promise to provide you with only the best evidence-based products.” ~Dr. Gleaton\n\n\n\nThroughout my interview with Dr. Gleaton, we talk about a variety of topics and answer a lot of your questions: \n\n\n\nWhat is infertilityHow can you boost your fertilityWhat factors impact fertilityWhat can cause infertilityWhy more women struggling with infertility \n\n\n\nIf you’re ready to learn more, I highly recommend listening to this interview and checking out Natalist!\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kenosha Gleaton\n\n\n\nIG: @kenoshagleatonmd\n\n\n\nWebsite: www.natalist.com\n\n\n\nBio: Dr. Kenosha Gleaton is board certified in gynecology and obstetrics.
