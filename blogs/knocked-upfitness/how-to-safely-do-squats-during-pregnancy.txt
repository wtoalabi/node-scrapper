"How To Safely Do Squats During Pregnancy!\nSquats can be a great exercise during pregnancy because they not only help keep your legs, glutes + core strong, but they can also help alleviate hip pain, SI joint pain and rebalance your pelvis. Before you jump in, here are a few tips to keep in mind to safely do squats during pregnancy. \n\nAs you progress through your pregnancy, you may notice that you are not able to go as low into your squats as you previously have. That is absolutely ok! Make sure you are only moving through a range of motion that feels good for your body. \nYou should also never feel any pulling or tension in your low back. If you start to feel this, reconnect through your pelvic floor + deep core and shorten your range of motion. \nAvoid tucking your bum and/or over-arching your back. This can cause your pelvic floor + deep core connection to shut off and put unnecessary pressure on your low back.\n\n\nParallel Squats\n\nOn your inhale, breathe into your sides and deep into your back.\nOn your exhale, lightly connect through the pelvic floor and low belly. \nKeep your shoulders relaxed and lengthening through the top of your head.\nAs you lower down, make sure your weight is evenly distributed through your feet (this includes your toes!)\nAs you come up, keep that light connection in your pelvic floor + low belly.\nUse the muscles on the underside of your bum to help bring you up.\n\nMedial Squats\n\nRotate your feet slightly inward.\nOn your inhale, breathe into your sides and deep into your back.\nOn your exhale, lightly connect through the pelvic floor and low belly. \nKeep your shoulders relaxed and lengthening through the top of your head.\nAs you lower down, send your booty back, avoiding any tension or pulling in your low back.\nYou want to feel some spreading of those sits bones (bony parts of your bum).\nAs you come up, keep that light connection in your pelvic floor + low belly.\nUse the muscles on the underside of your bum to bring you up.\n\nWide Squats\n\nTake your feet out wide.\nOn your inhale, breathe into your sides and deep into your back.\nOn your exhale, lightly connect through the pelvic floor and low belly.\nKeep your shoulders relaxed and lengthening through the top of your head.\nAs you lower down, make sure your weight is evenly distributed through your feet (this includes your toes!).\nAs you come up, keep that light connection in your pelvic floor + low belly.\nUse the muscles on the underside of your bum to bring you up.\n\nI recommend doing 3 sets of 10-20 reps of each squat. This can help you stay strong, energized + feeling your best throughout your entire pregnancy! \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, is it safe to do squats during pregnancy, knocked-up fitness, Legs, postnatal fitness, pregnancy, pregnancy exercise, pregnancy fitness, Prenatal Fitness, squats during pregnancyShare:"
