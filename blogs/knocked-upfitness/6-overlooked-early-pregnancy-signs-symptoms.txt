"Nausea. Heightened sense of smell. A missed period. There are dozens of early pregnancy symptoms we are familiar with. Many of the traditional pregnancy indicators are not unique to pregnancy, and often present the week of a missed period or in the weeks following.\nFor many women, the time spent waiting for delayed menstruation (weeks after trying to conceive or when you think you may have become pregnant) can seem like a lifetime. Start your Knocked-Up Fitness membership today to stay confident and feeling sexy as those pregnancy hormones set in!\nWomen who are in tune with their bodies might be in luck! Earlier than any pregnancy test on the market, your body could be showing several signs and symptoms of pregnancy. Here are 6 often over-looked pregnancy symptoms that could appear before a positive.\n\n1) Spotting\nWas that my period? If it was a little light and a little early, you could be confusing early menstruation with implantation bleeding. Usually occurring between 6-12 days post conception, the embryo implants itself and can cause light spotting.\n\n2) Fatigue and Tiredness\nIf you’re almost falling asleep at the dinner table, or sneaking to your car at work for ten minutes of shut eye, your body could be telling you baby is on board. In the 1st week after conception, progesterone levels rise, blood sugar can lower, and blood pressure can drop to provide greater blood flow to baby. That afternoon energy drop might be telling you something.\n\n3) Dizziness\nAlong with feeling fatigued, you may experience dizziness or light-headedness, which can also begin to occur in the first week after conception. As blood vessels dilate and blood pressure drops you can be at risk for dizziness and even fainting, so be sure to take a seat and a drink of water if you’re not feeling yourself.\n\n4) Shortness of Breath\nWhen did the stairs to my office triple in height? Baby needs oxygen and blood to develop and grow, so even though a pregnancy test won’t tell you for sure, in the first few weeks after conception sharing your oxygen and blood with baby can cause shortness of breath. While not usually dangerous, this uncomfortable and sometimes exhausting pregnancy symptom can be reduced by maintaining an exercise routine and listening to your body (aim to get to work a few minutes early to slow down on the stairs and take a short break before beginning your day).\n\n5) Swollen/Tender Breasts\nYour hormones begin to shift as soon as conception occurs, and within 1-2 weeks of pregnancy, many symptoms can present. Some breast changes, including darkening or leaking, are more often associated with later pregnancy, but swollen and tender breasts can begin 1-2 weeks after conception. Often confused with tenderness associated with PMS, many women note that breast swelling as a pregnancy symptom is much more intense than PMS tenderness.\n \n6) Food Aversions\nIf you find yourself nauseated by the thought of a meal you used to love, it might not be the flu or changing tastes. Although cravings get the bulk of the pregnancy cliche attention, food aversions can have a stronger effect on women. Food aversions can present within two weeks of conception, and are attributed to hormonal changes. Many experts agree that aversions to some foods are a biological response to pregnancy so women avoid foods that are dangerous to baby, including alcohol, and processed or spoiled foods. Strong food aversions, coupled with a heightened sense of smell can be a strong contributor to pregnancy-related nausea.\n \n\nSo if you’re staring at your calendar, waiting for the day you can successfully take a pregnancy test, ease your mind by paying close attention to the signs your body might be giving you.
