"You have made it to 28 weeks, congratulations! To me, this is the mark of the 3rd trimester. While what got me through my 1st trimester was geared towards staying healthy and feeling as well as possible during the queezy days, the 2nd trimester is much more pleasant and all about getting prepared!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMy 2nd-trimester lifesavers are:\nKeeping Up With My Knocked-Up Fitness Membership\nThe last 3 months have had me feeling extremely strong and competent when it comes to working out. So much so that I have been able to get into the gym five to six times a week. Being a Prenatal Fitness Trainer, I tend to follow my KUF videos and write my own workouts, focusing on the entire body with each workout lasting approx 1 hour. This routine has helped me avoid hip, back and joint pain almost altogether. It has also really helped me maintain my weight gain (ladies in my family have gained between 40 and 60 pounds per pregnancy) to about two to four pounds each month. Try my favorite Prenatal Sculpt workouts in our membership!\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRegular Chiropractic Adjustments\nStarting at about 22 weeks I began to see a chiropractor I really trusted every other week. There are a ton of benefits to this practice which I have seen first hand in my training as a Doula. Some benefits include: keeping loose joins aligned, relieving joint pain, preventing a breech baby, reduced labor time and preventing a C-section. While I have been able to avoid a lot of the aches and pains associated with pregnancy by staying active, the routine of self-care really helped and makes me feel productive! If you are interested in chiropractic care, be sure and find a CERTIFIED PRENATAL CHIROPRACTOR! You can find these online.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSwelling Prevention\nOkay, ladies, I have heard gripes about pregnancy swelling for the last six years from my clients, friends and sister and let me tell you… they were not lying! Like clockwork, I woke up on my 26th week feeling like the Michelin Man. Your amniotic fluid is at its peak during the 28th week so this is totally normal but none the less uncomfortable. I have been relying heavily on Turmeric Spice* in my water as well as Lemon Essential Oil and Grapefruit Essential Oil in my bath to keep the swelling at bay.\nFor the water, all I do is add 3 dashes of Turmeric Spice* and a squeeze of lemon in my first water of the day. This really helps reduce inflammation around the joins and gets me moving much easier. *Take note: only use as much spice as you would to season food. For breastfeeding Mamas, gradually increase from 1 dash to 3 as it could have a drying effect on your milk.\nIn the tub, I add one or two drops each of the Lemon and Grapefruit Oils with Epson salts and almond oil into lukewarm water and soak for about 30 min in the bath. When I get out I feel like a new woman!\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCombating Pregnancy Mask\nAlright… so this one is my favorite weird preggo find. I knew I was going to get some new spots during pregnancy because my skin reacts to the sunlight very easily. What I have found that works the best as a lightening pregnancy mask or melasma, is Milk of Magnesia! I use this one and all you do is apply some to a cotton round and wipe it on like a toner. I keep mine on overnight and wake up with lighter spots every time. It takes about two weeks to see a change so be patient and avoid chemical alternatives.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tI hope these help all my Mamas out there. Let me know what your favorite lifesavers have been in the comments!\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: 2nd Trimester, Erica Ziel, Exercise Video, Fitness, healthy pregnancy, knocked-up fitness, labor, melasma, Nutrition, pregnancy, pregnancy health, pregnancy swelling, pregnancy tips, prenatal exercise, prenatal health, stages of pregnancyShare:"
