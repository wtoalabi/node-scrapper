"You are pregnant… congratulations! Now how do you even begin to go through the dos and don’ts of what’s safe to eat during pregnancy?\n\n\n\nWhen I hear pregnant mamas talk about what’s safe to eat during pregnancy, I know this overwhelming fear is following them in all that they do *even with movement*.\n\n\n\nLadies, you’re in for a treat because Dr. Harriet Holme took over our Instagram to break down what foods are safe for you to eat during pregnancy. Dr. Holme is a registered nutritionist who brings science-based research into determining what you should be doing to nourish your body.\n\n\n\nAs a former pregnant mama myself, I have personal experience with trying to navigate the unknowns of what is safe to eat during pregnancy and what should be avoided.\n\n\n\nThat’s why I know this information is going to be so valuable for you during your pregnancy journey.\n\n\n\nSo let’s have Dr. Holme break it down for us!\n\n\n\nCheese\n\n\n\nWho doesn’t love cheese, right?! But is it okay to consume during pregnancy?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely! *However there’s a big “but” about to come in.*\n\n\n\nCheese is safe to eat during pregnancy BUT it comes down to the availability  of water in it.\n\n\n\nYou can pretty much eat any pasteurized hard cheese because of it’s little water availability therefore the harmful bacteria (listeria) can’t grow in it.\n\n\n\nPasteurized soft cheese is a bit more tricky. Soft cheeses that are safe to eat during pregnancy are ricotta or mozzarella. One that you should stay away from is brie because there is more water in it.\n\n\n\nAny cooked cheese is safe to eat because the bacteria has been killed off. YAY!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEggs\n\n\n\nThere’s more to this food than being a breakfast staple. They can be found uncooked in things such as homemade ice cream and dressings. That being said, uncooked eggs or lightly cooked eggs should be avoided during pregnancy because they carry the risk of salmonella.\n\n\n\nSushi\n\n\n\nIn the United States, there’s a regulation that states that fish intended to be eaten raw, such as sushi, must be frozen first. This is done so it can kill off the parasitic worms.\n\n\n\nSo go on and eat all the fish that‘s frozen first! Except…\n\n\n\nYou need to avoid fish that is high in mercury like big tuna and swordfish. Besides that, other fish such as salmon and regular tuna can absolutely be enjoyed during pregnancy because of their Omega 3’s that will help with baby’s brain and retinal development.\n\n\n\nNot to mention it’s good for mama!\n\n\n\nNuts\n\n\n\nA common question that Dr. Holme gets asked is if it’s more likely or less likely for the baby to become allergic to nuts if they are eaten during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nShe shares that there is no evidence that shows that eating nuts is putting your baby at risk or that they’re more likely to have a nut allergy.\n\n\n\nSo *if you’re not allergic* go ahead and eat nuts as they are really good for your heart health.\n\n\n\nThis is only a few of the awesome information that Dr. Holme has to share in her Instagram takeover so don’t miss out on more in the video below!\n\n\n\nAnd remember this mama: you are doing your best.\n\n\n\nTake what resonates with you today and know that we are here to support you when you need it.\n\n\n\n\nDR.
