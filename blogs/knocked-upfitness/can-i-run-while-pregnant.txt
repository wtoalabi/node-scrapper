"Mama, do you have questions about running during pregnancy? Need tips for running while pregnant to keep you and baby healthy?\n\n\n\nAs much as I’d love to say, “Yes, mama, run for the hills!” it’s not that simple.\n\n\n\nIn fact, running during pregnancy isn’t for everyone but don’t sweat it! If it’s not for you there are plenty of other types of exercise you can do during your pregnancy to keep you fit, healthy, help you prepare for labor & of course bounce back faster after baby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you have the mindset that you’re not going to let your bump hold you back from running during pregnancy, then I want you to be SUCCESSFUL.\n\n\n\nBecause I’m in the business of helping you feel your best during pregnancy, I wanted to share with you my tips for running while pregnant that you can take into your runs to help keep your deep core + pelvic floor engaged.\n\n\n\nHere are my tips for running while pregnant that can make an impact on your running game:\n\n\n\nALWAYS… LISTEN TO YOUR BODY!You should only consider running during your pregnancy if you were a runner BEFORE you got pregnant. Now is not the time to become a runner, you can do that after you heal your body after baby.Running should feel good! If it’s painful or you feel ligaments pulling, then it’s not a good idea + I would suggest walking instead because it has a much lower impact on your joints.Never run to exhaustion. Remember your baby needs to breathe too!Stay hydrated + never run in hot weather.Wear supportive tennis shoes.Slow your pace down and avoid sprinting. As your pregnancy progresses, you might find that you have to slow your pace down even more or shorten your time spent running. In this case, I recommend walking to replace your normal cardio.Try wearing a support belt especially if you are still running during the end of your 2nd and 3rd trimesters.If you weren’t able to run during your 1st trimester due to nausea or just plain fatigue, you can still run during your 2nd trimester providing all the recommendations above if you must.Your not trying to get in shape during pregnancy but rather maintain as much muscle mass and cardio endurance as you can. Whatever you lose or gain weight during pregnancy, you can find yourself balanced again after baby.\n\n\n\n*Check with your Doc to make sure you are cleared to exercise during your pregnancy*\n\n\n\nSTOP exercise if you experience any of the following:\n\n\n\nVaginal BleedingDifficulty BreathingDizzinessHeadacheChest PainMuscle WeaknessCalf Pain or SwellingPreterm LaborDecreased Fetal MovementAmniotic Fluid Leakage\n\n\n\nLet’s be real…if your body’s telling you not to run then you shouldn’t. Running never felt good during either of my pregnancies so I resorted to walking, elliptical and Pilates.\n\n\n\nI believe in the fact that you have the power to make the right decisions for your body, but if you’re still looking for a bit more support, I’ve got just the thing for you!\n\n\n\nLike I said before, I’m all about setting you up for success, and sometimes the pregnancy overwhelm can be too much.\n\n\n\nClick >>HERE!<< if you are ready to have fun staying fit during pregnancy with our Knocked-Up Fitness® Membership full of educational tutorials, coaching support and of course safe workouts that don’t contain any running.
