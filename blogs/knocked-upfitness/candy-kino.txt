Squats, because they are so easy to do anywhere and while wearing anything – I love to get the booty on in the morning. Planking, because they are so great for working the deep core and upper body.\nQ: What is the #1 thing you learned from Erica’s Prenatal and Postnatal Exercise Specialist course?\nA: The importance of training our fascia and not just our muscles. How that focus can generate so much more strength in the body. \nQ: What is your favorite inspirational quote?\n\nA: I see people caught up in a life cycle full of stress and rush that they forget to be happy. My ethos is to live a happy and healthy life as people often people focus on the healthy part, but not the happy part. \nQ: Best pregnancy advice for all our pregnant mamas?\nA: See a qualified prenatal exercise specialist to discuss what is and isn’t appropriate for you to do throughout your pregnancy to keep you strong and fit in order to minimize pregnancy pains and help prepare your body for labor. And, importantly, take care of yourself through your pregnancy and pamper yourself whenever possible, as you are doing something remarkable in growing a beautiful baby and that can be really tough. You deserve a lot of TLC during this time – plus your baby will truly benefit from a relaxed and happy mama. \nQ: What was your favorite workout apparel you recommend to wear during the first trimester?\nA: Your usual gym gear until it isn’t comfortable, or perhaps looser tops if you want to hide your pregnancy longer. My favorite tights during early-mid pregnancy were Lululemon ones. \nQ: What is your healthy go-to snack?\nA: Nuts! Great source of good fat and protein. No prep required so easy to grab and go.\nQ: What advice for new instructors starting their own business?\nA: Connecting with your clients and nurturing a relationship with them is the key to having great, long-term clients. Always listen to your clients and tailor your teaching to them as much as possible, even in a bigger class.\nQ: What are your current top three obsessions?\nA: First and foremost, my newborn son, Ethan. Next, doing exercises that I couldn’t do while I was pregnant. Finally, food and eating healthy (I was terribly sick for my entire pregnancy and couldn’t eat much and couldn’t keep down most healthy foods).\nFor more information about Candy and her training…\nFind her on Instagram at @candy_kino or on her studio’s account @studiopp\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPrenatal & Postnatal Exercise Specialist Instructor Course\nErica Ziel’s Prenatal and Postnatal Exercise Specialist Instructor Course is designed to educate and teach fitness professionals how to safely and effectively train their prenatal and postnatal clients while maximizing their results.\nInstructors can expect to learn:\n\nHow to properly identify diastasis in their prenatal and postnatal clients\nInsight into the female anatomy, fascia and postural changes that happen during pregnancy and postpartum\nVariables, limitations and modifications that will affect each client differently\nHow pregnancy workouts have an impact on a woman’s labor, delivery and recovery\nHow to minimize, heal and prevent diastasis in your prenatal and postnatal clients\nHow to strengthen your client’s newly postpartum body for life as a busy mom\nPrenatal and postnatal case studies allowing you to apply what you have learned to real-life scenarios\nAnd MUCH MORE!\n\nClick here to learn more about Erica’s Prenatal and Postnatal Exercise Specialist Instructor Course.\nTo learn more about Erica Ziel and/or other programs she to offer, visit her website at www.ericaziel.com.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nTags: course, exercise, Fitness, healthy, instructors, movement, specialist, trainingShare:"
