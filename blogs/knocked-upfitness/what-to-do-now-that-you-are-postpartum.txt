"Congratulations!!! Giving birth is no small feat and you just crushed it! So, now what? You might already be feeling a shift in your hormones, sleep deprivation or aches and pains in your lower back, neck and hips. This is all completely normal, however, there are things you can do make yourself feel better physically, mentally and emotionally!\n\n\nAnswering your early postpartum questions\nPosted by Knocked-Up Fitness on Wednesday, April 17, 2019\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGENTLE MOVEMENT\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t“Embrace the pace of your own journey.”\nI say movement, not exercise for a reason. In the first weeks postpartum, your body is still healing and moving back into place. Breathwork and light inversion movements are designed to awaken your pelvic floor, destress your body and eliminate those aches and pains. Take it slow and if you feel any pressure in your pelvic floor or experience any incontinence, stop. This is a sign your body needs more time to heal so wait a few more days to a week and try again.\nPelvic Tilts – Lay on your back with your feet flat on the floor. You should not feel any pressure on your hip flexors. If you do, try widening your legs a bit. Take a deep breath in and on the exhale, lightly connect your deep core and lengthen up through the top of your head. Remember, the connection in your pelvic floor should be light! If you can’t feel the connection, that is absolutely ok!! Visualize your pelvic floor lightly connecting and soon enough you will begin to feel it!\n\nHip Rolls – Lay on your back with your feet flat on the floor. Take a deep breath in and on the exhale, complete your pelvic tilt. Begin using your hamstrings and glutes to slowly peel your hips off the ground. You don’t want to go very high because the goal is to awaken your pelvic floor and take the stress off your lower back. This inversion work allows gravity to take over and begins to slightly pull your pelvic floor towards your core.\n\nInversion Hip Rolls – While you are doing your hip rolls, you can place a pillow or two under your hips to help create that inversion. Again, this will allow gravity to slowly begin pulling your pelvic floor toward your core.\n\nAs long as these movements feel good on your body, begin incorporating them into your daily routine. Once you have been fully released by your doctor, you can begin Phase 1 of your Core Rehab journey!\nAlways consult your doctor prior to beginning any new movement or workout routines. \n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGOOD QUALITY DEEP SLEEP\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t“The best eraser in the world is a good night’s sleep.”\nThis is always a struggle for all new parents and often causes stress, irritability and anxiety. Since your new bundle of joy will need to eat and/or be changed every few hours, your ability to fall into the deep cycles of sleep is limited, if not eliminated. Come up with a schedule with your partner or ask a friend or family member to come over for a few hours so you can get some good quality sleep. This can be a complete game changer when it comes to managing a newborn and life as a busy mom!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGETTING SOME FRESH AIR\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t“Slow down and enjoy the simple pleasures in life.”\nGetting outside and breathing in the fresh air can help rejuvenate your mind, body and spirit. If you feel up to it, go for a gentle walk. This can allow you to get your body moving, decrease stress and breath life back into your body. Fresh air does wonders for the body so don’t be afraid to get outside and enjoy it!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nJOINING THE RIGHT SUPPORT GROUP\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t“Life can be uncertain. Work can be unpredictable. But by surrounding yourself with great friends, support is guaranteed.” \nLife as a new mom is full of second-guessing yourself and endless questions.
