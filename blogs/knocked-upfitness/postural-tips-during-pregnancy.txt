"As your baby bump grows, your posture can shift, causing some aches + pains to creep in. To help you feel your best during pregnancy, here are some important postural tips to follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI invite you to do this exercise with me. Walk in place and then stop…\n\n\n\nDid your feet land naturally under your hips? If not, bring awareness to what your feet are doing. You want to feel your weight evenly distributed throughout both feet.Are you locking your knees? This is very common during pregnancy because of your growing baby bump. Locking your knees is the body’s way of cheating and puts unnecessary tension + stress on your low back. Start by softening your knees when you stand. This can help release your low back and allow you to connect through your pelvic floor and deep core more easily. Lets talk about your pelvis. There is a lot going on in your pelvis during pregnancy.  You want to avoid tucking your bum because it shuts off your pelvic floor + deep core and forces your low back to do more than it should. Instead, I recommend connecting through the base of your pelvic floor, zipping up through your deep core and lengthening tall through the top of your head. Are you rounding forward? To avoid this, focus on engaging your mid-back muscles. By lightly engaging your mid-back, you can use these muscles to hold up your neck and head, removing any tension. \n\n\n\nUse these postural tips during pregnancy when you are standing, sitting and moving throughout your day. By lightly engaging your pelvic floor and deep core, you can move more easily, sleep better and prepare your body for labor, delivery and recovery postpartum.  \n\n\n\nTake what you’ve learned from today and apply it in this free pregnancy workout!
