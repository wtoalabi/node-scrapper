"Check out these great effective resistance band exercises in my article \n“Resistance Workout“\nThis one’s my favorite:\n\n \nFor more exercises go to:\n– Prenatal Side Leg Press\n– Prenatal & Postnatal Exercise: Squats with Rotation\n– Prenatal Tricep Extension Exercise Video\n\nAll of these resistance band exercises are safe during all trimesters of pregnancy except the “Double Leg Stretch”. After your 1st trimester I’d omit the shoulder press “Lunge with shoulder press” but continuing lunges will help keep your rear in gear 🙂\n~E\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, Abs, After Baby, Core, erica, exercise, Lunge, Pilates, prenatal exercise, Prenatal Fitness, Resistance Band, Squat, Tight Bod With A Pod, VideosShare:"
