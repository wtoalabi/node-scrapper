"I love this exercise!\n\n\n\n\nIt’s great for targeting those deep abs, good during 1st Trimester & After Baby 🙂\n\n\n\n\n**Always check with your Doctor before beginning any exercise program**\n\n\n\nFocus: Abs/Core\n\n\n\n\t\n\nLegs laterally rotated\n\n\n\t\n\nNeutral spine\n\n\n\t\n\nStart with a small range of motion ~ once you master the smaller range of motion then you can lower your legs lower, but keep out of your back ~ this is an abdominal exercise!\n\n\n\t\n\nThink “Ribs to Hips” & “Scoop your belly In & Up”\n\n\n\t\n\nLift your hips up towards the ceiling, not towards your head.\n\n\n\n\n\nModifications:\n\n\n\n\t\n\nImprint your spine if you feel in your low back (meaning gently press your lower back towards your mat) ~ (I didn’t say jam, i said gently)\n\n\n\t\n\nIf you feel more in your neck than abs, just do the leg movement. You can support more my placing your hands under your hips\n\n\n\t\n\nTake your shoes off to make it easier\n\n\n\t\n\nSmaller range of motion…\n\n\n\t\n\nAlways be sure you have the smaller range of motion/basic movements down before you progress on….\n\n\n\t\n\nTo make more challenging add pulses at the end of your 10-30 reps\n\n\n\n\n\nReps: 10-30\nSets: 1-4\nOther great ab exercises\n\n\n\n\t\n\nSingle Leg Abs\n\n\n\t\n\nCriss Cross Abs\n\n\n\t\n\nStability Ball Core\n\n\n\t\n\nPlank Series\n\n\n\n\n\n~E\n\n]]>\t\t\nTags: 1st Trimester, Abs, After Baby, Core, exerciseShare:"
