"Have you ever found yourself wondering what the difference between folate and folic acid is?\n\n\n\nIf so, you’re not alone! As a pre and postnatal exercise specialist, this is a question that gets asked time and time again.\n\n\n\n>>Mama, if you’ve been here for a while then you know that I want to empower you with education so that you can make the best decisions for you, your body, and your baby.<<\n\n\n\nMy guest Steph Greunke and I want you to take what you learn here today and talk to your provider about it because this conversation around folate and folic acid isn’t that well known…even with those who have been in this world for 20 years!\n\n\n\nThat’s why we’re going to be talking about the difference between folate and folic acid in preparing for pregnancy and while you’re bumping!\n\n\n\nWhat Is Folic Acid?\n\n\n\nFolic acid is a synthetic vitamin that is used with women who are trying to conceive and who are pregnant to prevent neural tube defects and help with midline functioning of baby.\n\n\n\nWe know it’s important and we get that.\n\n\n\nBUT we also know that there is a better form that works well for ALL people called methylfolate.\n\n\n\nUpwards to 60% of us can’t actually use the folic acid that we’re getting due to a genetic variant (MTHFR) that makes it hard to convert folic acid into methylfolate.\n\n\n\nHow Do You Know If You Have This Defect? \n\n\n\nIf you’re thinking about getting pregnant or you are pregnant, ask your provider to run a test for MTHFR and that will tell you if you are a part of that 60% of the population that can’t convert folic acid into methylfolate. \n\n\n\nWhich as we now know is what your body needs for you and your baby to have a healthy pregnancy.\n\n\n\nIf they won’t run the test for you, there’s no harm in taking the form that will work for your body instead of a folic acid…aka methylfolate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Ingredients Should You Be Looking For In A Prenatal Vitamin?\n\n\n\nIn concerns to MTHFR, when you flip over your prenatal vitamin make sure that it doesn’t say folic acid but rather it says metafolin, L-5-THMF, or methylfolate.\n\n\n\nSide Note: you’re not going to lose anything by having methylfolate in your prenatal over folic acid. Here are some prenatal vitamin brands that Steph recommends to her mamas:\n\n\n\nSeeking HealthDesigns for Health – Prenatal Pro™NeededThorn – Basic Prenatal\n\n\n\n*Note: this post contains affiliate links to some of Steph and I’s recommended prenatal vitamins.

This can positively impact egg quality and help you get ahead of the game. Having your partner take a methylfolate supplement as well can also impact sperm quality.\n\n\n\nOn my Core Connections podcast conversation with Steph, we talk about how your prenatal vitamin during pregnancy has implications for DNA and red blood cell synthesis, cell division, cardiovascular health, and neural tube development.\n\n\n\n>>You also don’t want to stop taking all of this the second your baby is here.<<\n\n\n\nIt’s important that you’re continuing to nourish your cells once you’re postpartum because let’s face it…life with kids is crazy! As you’re doing whatever you can to get nourishing foods in, a supplement will help ensure that you’re filling in the gaps of what’s missing in your diet.\n\n\n\nIf you want to see Steph and I’s whole *candid* conversation on folate vs. folic acid, you can check it out on our Instagram >>HERE!<<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe material contained within is provided for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice. You should seek prompt medical care for any specific health issues and consult your physician before beginning a new regimen or purchasing any product(s).\nTags: folate and folic acid, folate deficiency, folate pregnancy, folate supplement, folate vs folic acid for pregnancy, folate vs. folic acid, mthfr, mthfr mutation pregnancy, mthfr supplements, prenatal vitaminsShare:"
