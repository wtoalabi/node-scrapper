"A close friend of mine, Angela,  recently lost her mother to a rare but very fast acting form of Leukemia. I myself could not believe it at all when it happened so suddenly. One day she told me about finding out her mom had cancer then within less then 3 weeks she had passed. Moms are our rock, I know mine is, especially after having 3 little ones. Itâ€™s nice to be able to call her when I just need to talk or need a little extra parenting advice when Iâ€™m running out of ideasâ€¦\nTo help Angela with her BIG Team In Training Fundraising goal, Iâ€™ll be teaching, along with a few other amazing trainers, a Bootcamp workout at the beach. I know many of you are not local but there are other ways you too can participate and help donate. See below for all the info.\nHereâ€™s the Facebook event link if youâ€™d like to rsvp there & invite your friends.\nI do and I know Angela, appreciates any donations that can help her reach her $50,000 goal!  The easiest is to purchase a TNT Fitbook. If youâ€™ve never used a fitbook itâ€™s a GREAT tool to keep your healthy eating and exercise goals on track (plus set new ones). Check them out here!\nThank You ðŸ™‚\n~Erica\nÂ \nÂ \nÂ \nTags: Beach Bootcamp, Crossfit Vibe, Erica Ziel, Fitbook, fitlosophy, Fundraiser, Kevin Forbes, OC, Ritual Wellness, TNTShare:"
