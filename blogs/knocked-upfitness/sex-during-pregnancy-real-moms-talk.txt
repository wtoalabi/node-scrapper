"If you’re pregnant, or thinking about trying to conceive soon, you’ve probably thought a least a little about sex! If you’re curious about how other women deal with sex during pregnancy, this is the place for you! We talked to 200 moms and, not surprisingly, many have similar experiences and concerns.\nSex during pregnancy can be completely safe, and even healthy for your body– but pregnancy can change a lot of things, including your sex drive. Some women find sex more exciting and even better than before pregnancy, while many others struggle with discomfort, both physically and emotionally, during sex.\n\nIt’s important to understand is that many of the changes to you and your partners sexual preferences during pregnancy are totally normal, and health experts agree changes in sex during pregnancy are often attributed to hormonal fluctuations. What’s also amazing is that exercise can actually increase your energy level, and improve your body image & confidence! Here’s what some real moms have shared with Knocked-Up Fitness about their sex life during pregnancy!\n” I had a big sex drive when I was pregnant but my husband didn’t want to have sex because I had some bleeding early on and he didn’t want to hurt the baby.”\n“Sex during pregnancy was almost non-existent. I was sick for 20 weeks and then the last half of my pregnancy I was large, miserable, and felt unattractive.”\n“I had a high drive until I got pregnant with my first. Then it disappeared like magic.”\n“I had a high sex drive during my pregnancy and the couple weeks after…I was also open to a lot more things sexually during my pregnancies.”\n“Pregnancy was the first time I felt totally secure with my body in years, so sex was great!”\n“I had no sex drive in the first trimester; I was nauseous and exhausted. Then in my second trimester I started feeling a little better, and resuming my workouts, and my sex drive came back stronger than ever!”\nSo if you’re feeling less than motivated to get busy– or if you’re one of many women who feel liberated and wonderful during pregnancy– the good news is it’s probably pretty common, and you’re not alone! Always remember to talk with your doctor about your concerns during pregnancy, and listen to your body & do what feels comfortable!\n \nCheck Back With Us Next Week to Read What Our Real Moms Said About Sex After Pregnancy!!\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *\nJulianna\nOther Related Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\nMy 2nd Pregnancy {Push Prep}\n\nWhat Moms Are Saying {Testimonials}\n\n5 Tips to Motivate Moms-to-Be\n\n\n \nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, Erica Ziel, healthy pregnancy, hormones, Julianna, knocked-up fitness, pregnancy, Real moms, Real talk, sex, Sex and Pregnancy, Sex During Pregnancy, week-by-week pregnancyShare:"
