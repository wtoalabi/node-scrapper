"Ezra was evicted January 14th, 2014 and much like my first 2 sons, it was a pretty relaxed and easy delivery. I say evicted because at 39 weeks and 2 days I went in for a scheduled induction, out of fear of having a jumbo baby. They were concerned that he would be too large to labor naturally.\n\n\n\nWhen I went to my midwife a week prior with contractions, we agreed that if by that time next week he hadn’t come on his own we would politely ask him to leave. Sure enough, despite contracting all week, by Tuesday the 14th at 7:30am he was still snug as a bug in a rug!\n\nAt 10 am they started me on Pitocin, by 1pm I hadn’t made much progress and was still terribly comfortable so they broke my water. Oh and terribly hungry at this point, I mean if I’m gonna drink my lunch I’d prefer it be a smoothie not beef broth and lime jello.YUCK! I didn’t start having contractions that were uncomfortable until around 5pm at that point I was still only 4-5cm dilated. Thanks to all the prenatal exercise I was able to be up and walking for most of my delivery, even did a little dancing! I had informed the fabulous nurses and my amazing midwife that I usually am really comfortable until about 7cm dilated and then I go from 7-10 FAST! A sure sign I’m in transition is I throw up, once that happens we have about 15 mins until go time. And sure enough at around 7:45 I puked and informed my husband it was time for me to get in the bed and he to go get some nurses.\n\nThe next 25 mins was a bit of a blur. When the midwife came to check me, baby was already in the birth canal and ready to roll. And roll he did, he came so quickly that I had to call for someone to come catch him, cause he was coming whether I pushed or not! I am so glad I had been squatting and stretching because with not so much as a Tylenol and minimal effort out came an 8lb 12oz handsome little man. Seriously I mean he is so handsome, its stupid.\n\nHe just turned 3 weeks today and is a happy, healthy, chunky baby. His brothers love him and always want to help. I’m feeling really good and itching to start working out again!\n\n\nDon’t forget to sign up for the Knocked-Up Fitness Newsletter to stay updated!\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *\nOther Related Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\nPrenatal: Push Prep\nReal Mom Blogs: Julia at 34 Weeks Pregnant!\nJulianna’s Birth Story: Welcome Baby Lincoln!\n\nBigger Postpartum Challenges!\n\n\nTags: 39 weeks pregnant, 3rd Trimester, After Baby, Erica Ziel, exercise, Julianna, knocked-up fitness, labor, postnatal fitness, Postpartum, pregnancy, pregnancy fitness, Real Mom Blogs, Real moms, Real talk, week-by-week pregnancyShare:"
