"As moms, getting sick is just not an option! However, with littles just learning not to sneeze directly in your face, this makes it hard to avoid. So, what can we do when the inevitable happens?\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nREST\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tI know this is so much easier said than done, but you cannot get better without adequate rest. If your partner or a family member can’t come help, try this new app called Bambino. It is a babysitter on-demand app that will link you with trusted sitters in your area. You can use it for a day or just a few hours so you can nap.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLIPOSOMAL VITAMIN C\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tI have been taking this for a while and truly believe it helps improve immunity, energy, brain fog and more!

Learn more about Liposomal Vitamin C and the difference between it and regular Vitamin C.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMIRACLE MINERAL BATH\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWait to do this until your fever has gone down because you want the water nice and warm to open up your pores. Fill your bath with warm water, 1 cup epson salt, ½ cup sea salt, 1/3 cup baking soda and ginger root or crushed ginger. Allow your body to soak for at least 30-45 minutes in order for your body to absorb all the good stuff. Follow your bath with socks and cozy Pjs!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGARLIC IN YOUR SOCKS\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOk, gross I know but, it can make a huge difference! Garlic is a natural anti-viral and anti-fungal, and has major immune boosting properties. What I do is crush about four cloves of garlic in a bowl to make a paste.  Rub the paste on the bottom of your feet and cover with socks. Sleep with the paste on your feet over night and wash them off with warm water in the morning. Feels weird, but works great!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, most major colds and flus have to run their course and can stay around for a few days. Avoid spreading it to your family by wearing a mask and washing your hands every time you touch your face. Lastly, follow these tips to help get you back to your old self quickly!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFor more tips and tricks, check out Erica’s Prenatal+Core Rehab Membership!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: After Baby, baby, cold season, flu season, health tip, Health tips, healthy baby, healthy kids, Healthy Lifestyle, healthy pregnancy, Healthy Tips, knocked-up fitness, Nutrition, Postpartum, pregnancy, pregnancy health, pregnant, pregnant women, prenatal health, Real moms, Real talkShare:"
