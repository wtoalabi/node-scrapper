If you are experiencing any knee discomfort, you may want to double up your mat. You NEVER want to have any pain when you’re moving especially during pregnancy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you are going to be on all fours and place your booty somewhere between a cat cow position and a child’s pose. While looking straight down at your mat, you are going to take a deep inhale breathing into your back.\n\n\n\nOn your exhale, lightly zip up and give your baby a gentle hug as you start to round your spine to come partway up to the center letting your head fall. As you inhale to go back, think about spreading your sits bones and reaching long through your fingers.\n\n\n\nExperiment with rounding your spine so that you’re pressing each side up to the sky and looking underneath your armpit.\n\n\n\nAlways finish in the center to open your chest and get opposition through your spine as you come up to a seated position.\n\n\n\nWant to see this movement in action?!\n\n\n\nCheck out the video below as I cue you through this pregnancy back pain relief exercise!\n\n\n\nLooking for more of our unique training techniques?
