Some tell me their doctors says surgery is the only option – I can’t express how frustrating this is!!!!\nNeither are good or correct answers.\nYou can work to heal diastasis recti naturally and safely through proper movement and fascial activation. That’s what my program is all about!\nPlus so much more. Not only will your core feel stronger then ever before, but your entire body, the way you move, stand, sit and carry will transform how your feel both physically and emotionally!\nNot sure if you have abdominal separation?\nClick here for my video where I show you how to test.\n \nA BIG piece that’s been missing for many is the full body approach. Yes – my Core Rehab Program is focused on strengthening your core – and…also your entire body.\nYes, you will do abdominal exercises but in a new way – a way that will equal results like you’ve never experienced before.\nEverything works together – the better everything works together the sooner your core and abdominal strength will improve as will diastasis recti.\nSo stop trying to do countless ‘ab exercises’ and let’s learn to do the right exercises the correct way.\nYou will learn so much more about your body and movement and how it can impact your life not only now – but forever.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: abdominal separation, Abs, After Baby, Core, core rehab, Diastasis Recti, diastasis recti test, Erica Ziel, postnatal fitness, Real moms, Real talk, the core rehab program, what is diastasis rectiShare:"
