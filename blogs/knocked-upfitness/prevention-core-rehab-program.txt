"Today I’m talking Prevention and the many things that can affect our bodies due to pregnancy, birth, postpartum, motherhood and life in general!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPrevention is something I’m passionate about because so many women think that pain is ‘normal’. Incontinence isn’t something you have to suffer from. An abdominal separation and weakened core are not definite after pregnancy! Back pain doesn’t HAVE to come along with pregnancy and motherhood!\nThe majority of women who suffer from back pain are exacerbating their pains due to poor posture! Daily activities can put a lot of pressure on the pelvic floor. Being seated too long and not engaging your deep core causes weakness and loss of connections. If you’re working at a desk, sitting up nursing your baby, or exercising without properly engaging your core, you might be experiencing unnecessary back pain. Without proper core function training, your body is at risk for incontinence, prolapsed organs, and a host of other discomforts ranging from annoying to severe.\n But here’s the good news… prevention is totally possible!!!!\nThe Core Rehab Program teaches you all of the prevention tactics you can use in your daily life! If you’re someone who exercises regularly, you might still be gripping your muscles too tightly. This adds to and creates so many common physical discomforts, and prevention is more accessible than ever. My training focuses on being fascially fluid. In Core Rehab, you’ll learn to focus on lengthening & strengthening in your movements. Improving your fascial connections can aid in the prevention of poor core function (aka PAIN!).\nIf you’re planning to grow your family in the future, Core Rehab is the prevention tool you need to teach you to engage your core, connect, and lengthen through every movement. You’ll be able to move easily between my Prenatal Membership during pregnancy, to Core Rehab once you’re cleared to exercise after baby. Plus, continuing to engage in your daily life using the prevention tactics I teach is the best way to ensure that your core stays strong at every stage of life.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEven if you don’t suffer from core dysfunctions like diastasis recti, pelvic organ prolapse, incontinence, back pain, etc., The Core Rehab Program is still for you. This program teaches you life skills for prevention of pregnancy discomforts, reduce exercise-related strains, and improves postpartum recovery!\nP.S.
