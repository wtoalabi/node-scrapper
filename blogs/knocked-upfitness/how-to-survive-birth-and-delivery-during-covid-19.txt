"Is the countdown on until you welcome your newborn into the world?\n\n\n\nWhether this is your first child or your fifth, the delivery room is going to be a little different than what you’re expecting.\n\n\n\nAfter COVID-19 took over all of our lives a year ago, your plans for pregnancy and delivery took a bit of a hit. \n\n\n\n>>Instead of letting your stress level rise as you enter the unknown of delivering your baby during COVID-19, I want you to focus on the things you can control.<<\n\n\n\nBeing able to enter the delivery room in a flow state will allow you to be present and visualize what you want out of your birth.\n\n\n\nSo, I’m going to share some ways to prepare for delivery during COVID-19 so you can focus on what matters: having a happy and healthy baby. Let’s get started!\n\n\n\nPlanning Ahead\n\n\n\nAround here, we believe that preparation is the best way to prevent unnecessary stress and overwhelm.\n\n\n\nHeck, we have a whole section in our membership dedicated to Birth Prep! \n\n\n\nSome common things we suggest as you enter a COVID-19 delivery are:\n\n\n\nPacking a cooler with snacks in case you can’t go to the cafeteria.Having something to watch your favorite shows on in case your room doesn’t have a TV.Buying an extra-long cell phone charger to reach your bed.\n\n\n\nCalling the hospital ahead of time can help you better understand their current policies and feel confident in your planning before you even enter the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovement\n\n\n\nIncorporating movement during the labor process is a great way to reconnect with your body (and baby!) as you head into pushing baby out. If COVID-19 is keeping you from being able to walk the hospital halls, turn on your favorite tunes and move your body! \n\n\n\nSome amazing movements you can do on the side of your bed are:\n\n\n\nWide squat pulsesCat-cowsPelvic tilts and hip circles on a maternity ball\n\n\n\nFinding what moves make you feel strong and confident can help reduce your stress while preparing you for an amazing delivery.\n\n\n\nBreathe\n\n\n\nOne of the best things that I’ve learned since becoming a prenatal and postnatal exercise specialist is the power that breath has on the body.\n\n\n\nSo in between nurses coming to your room or during a commercial break, take some time for yourself to just breathe. Focus on centering yourself and visualize the way you want your labor and delivery to go.\n\n\n\nAre you ready to get additional support?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter yet, do you want to talk with real prenatal and postnatal exercise specialists who have helped thousands of women prepare their bodies for birth and delivery?
