"Yeah Baby! that explores the unknowns of pregnancy to new mama’s to expand your pregnancy knowledge.\nIt was great to chat with Jillian about her new book. I was thrilled to see that she includes a much more holistic approach then I’ve seen with other general pregnancy books {avoiding toxins, thyroid, supplementation, and more}.\nMs. Jillian Michaels:  “the reason I wanted to {write this book} is because I was absolutely stunned and aghast… that, A: the amount of misinformation, B: the amount of dated information, and C: the tremendous influence that Big Food and Big Pharma have on mainstream information simply because they do a lot of advertising in those publications and on those websites.”\nI couldn’t agree more with that! There is a lot of dated info out there and a lot that’s being pushed by Big Pharma! So frustrating![/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text][/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\n\n\nGrab your copy of ‘Yeah Baby’ here!\n\n\n\n\nIt’s Okay to Get Another Opinion\n\n\n\n\nMs. Jillian Michaels:  “if it doesn’t feel right to you, get multiple opinions, please.  Be proactive because I think that we’re so quick to give up our way and say, “Oh, well, these doctors are gods.  They know everything.” We do that in various aspects of our lives.  They are the expert.  They know.\n\n\n\n\nBut, that isn’t the case. There are great lawyers, there are bad lawyers.  There are great doctors, there are bad doctors.  Doctors don’t know everything, and they know very little about nutrition or environmental toxins and so on.  So, be very proactive, get all the information, and then make the decisions that are right for your family. “\n\n\n\n\nSo so true mamas – it’s always a good idea to get a second opinion, especially if it doesn’t feel right.\n\n\n\n\nHormones and Pregnancy \n\n\nMs. Jillian Michaels:   “my introduction to this conversation came because–and you’ll read this in the book, but what happened was, Heidi and I ended up in a fertility clinic not because she was infertile.  She’s 32 years old, perfectly healthy, but because we’re a same-sex couple.  So we get sent there because we’re going to be inseminated, and all of a sudden, they’re like, oh, we need to run all these tests.\n Why are you not getting pregnant with so much time having gone by?” They found that she was hyperthyroid, and I had no idea how dramatically the mother’s thyroid hormone impacts the baby, how significant and important it is.\nWe ended up having to get her thyroid levels in check, with Dr. Van Herle, who’s the book’s endocrinologist, –and I was like, well, what would have happened if she’d gotten pregnant?  Then what?  And she’s like, oh, we deal with it in the midst.  And I was like, why doesn’t anybody say this?  \nHow come nobody’s saying, “Hey, you know, if you’re going to get pregnant in the next X amount of years, just make sure you prep the body and you take six months at least to get your ducks in a row.”  No one has ever had that conversation with anyone I know, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.“\n\n\nNutrition and Pregnancy\n\n\nMs. Jillian Michaels:  “I think a lot of women don’t appreciate that the things that we can do or you’re consuming while you’re pregnant have such a dramatic, long-term impact on your child from not only their taste in certain foods but in their level or amount of fat cells, whether or not they’re predisposed to obesity, their IQ, their long-term earning potential, their cardiovascular conditioning.\nYou’ll never have a chance for the rest of both your lives to influence them positively in the way you can when you’re growing them inside your tummy.\nI think when women see how powerful they truly are with their food choices: your child’s intelligence, their healthy weight, their athleticism, their tastes in foods– that’s when they’ll really be motivated.”\n\n\nThe Modern Mama’s Guide to Mastering Pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\nYou know Jillian Michaels as the world’s leading fitness expert, celebrity trainer, author and a renowned nutritionist; but she’s also a proud mother of two.
