"Pregnancy Is The BEST Time To Learn To Strengthen Your Deep Core Muscles!\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThis goes beyond just strengthening your ‘abs’. While tightening and toning is definitely a goal for many moms, core training is all about learning how to strengthen your entire deep core. When you’re learning to connect to your deep core when you’re pregnant, you have your baby in your belly to lightly ‘hug’ and it can actually help you find + feel your deep core muscles like you’ve never felt them before!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\nWhy Deep Core Strengthening is About More Than Just an 'Ab Workout'\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDeep core training encompasses specific methods (Push Prep™), improving your ability to connect with your deep core in every movement and, of course, performing the most effective exercises the correct way!\nWhen exercising, if the core is not correctly engaged, injury and even worsening of existing abdominal separations can occur. This is why it’s so important to learn in pregnancy how to accommodate your changing body. It might seem a little strange to think about ‘training your abs’ in pregnancy, but it’s actually the best time to connect with your belly and really feel your best when exercising and throughout your day!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSome of the benefits to learning how to strengthen your core during pregnancy:\n\nFewer aches + pains\nBetter posture\nMinimize diastasis recti\nEven improve diastasis recti\nBetter pelvic floor strength\nDecrease the likely hood of pelvic organ prolapse\nMore energy\nEasier delivery and recovery\nAchieving a toned and strengthened core {Hips to Shoulders}\nImprove body confidence!!\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAre you convinced yet?!\nBelow I’ve included 5 video clips of some great abdominal exercises for pregnancy. One of the biggest components in getting the results you want and need, is that you’re doing the right kind of exercises to help properly train and strengthen your abdominal muscles. More importantly, these exercises will help you connect with your deep core, so you can feel that connection, and even help heal your abs while you are pregnant!\nBecause it really is possible to get stronger while you are pregnant!\nI’ve always been fascinated by working with expecting mama’s, and seeing how much stronger their body becomes by working out! Becoming stronger does not just happen by staying physically active – it really requires learning and understanding how to strengthen your deep core properly, and how to move your body effectively so you feel good! What I’ve learned over the years training moms is that the physical changes of pregnancy can cause us to lose the connection with our core; however, with proper training and specific exercises, this connection can actually improve in pregnancy.\nYou’ll find a lot of my tutorials on how to strengthen your deep core, along with other recommended exercises, plus join me each month for a live group coaching call and much more when you start your Prenatal + Postnatal Membership!\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1) Pelvic Tilts\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2) Squats + Rotations\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3) Hip Rolls\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t4) Reach + Curls\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t5) Standing Pull Downs\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, Core, Diastasis Recti, Erica Ziel, exercise, exercise modifications, Exercise Video, knocked-up fitness, pregnancy exercise, pregnancy fitness, prenatal exerciseShare:"
