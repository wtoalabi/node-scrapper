Shortly after my announcement I started getting compliments and encouragement from others to start a business building baby blogs for other expecting mamas to document their own pregnancies. I put some thought into it, but I knew if I was going to start a small business I wanted to offer even more for expecting mothers. After designing my own party printables for my baby shower, I started getting tons of inquiries to do either baby blogs, invitations or printables for others. It was then that I realized maybe I really could turn this into a business. So I decided to give it a go and started Peanut in my Belly Co. as a one stop shop for all things mama and baby. Party planning, baby shower invites, birth announcements, birthday party invites, party printables, pregnancy/baby blogs etc. I wanted to deliver items that would help make becoming a mom a special experience for others, as it was for me. In 2014 I made the leap into apparel offering my “There’s a Peanut in my Belly” pregnancy announcement tees.—Kimberly Farrell (owner)\n\n\n\n\nHead on over to peanutinmybelly.com\nto snag a tee for yourself or an expecting friend!\n\n\n\n\nKnocked-Up Fitness readers get 20% off using the code KNOCKEDUPFIT at checkout.\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_8271\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"790\"] // Photo Cred.
