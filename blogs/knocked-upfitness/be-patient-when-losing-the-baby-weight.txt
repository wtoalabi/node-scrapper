"I love the inspiration moms have for getting into shape quickly after baby, but there are so many factors that can greatly affect how long it takes for you to accomplish this. Be patient when losing the baby weight mama! First, stop comparing yourself to the celebrities out there who are back “in shape” within the first 3 weeks! If you too had a personal chef to cook for you everyday, a trainer who made you workout 2 hours a day, then maybe, just maybe you could do it that quickly….\n\n \nReality check! As a new mom your body is going through so much! Did you notice that it took you 9 full months to take on your beautiful pregnant body? Well then, I hate to break it to you, but it’s not coming off in 3 weeks.\nThe very best advice I can give you is this: “BE PATIENT”! Yes!  You can have your pre-baby body back & even better!  If you ask me, the key is to take it slow. Focus on your day-to-day goals such as getting active everyday & eating healthy, rather than; “I still can’t squeeze into my jeans!” & “What’s with this muffin top!” awwwww!\n \nHere’s why:\n\nYour body needs time to adjust back – remember that 9 months I mentioned?\nYour hips & ribcage take time to move back to where they were. Being active really can help this.\nYour weight may not be that different after baby but you feel mushy. So now it’s time to focus on putting back on some muscle mass, which also happens to help speed up your metabolism = you burn more calories everyday! Yay!\nSkin, this one takes the longest, but the sooner you start strengthening your deep muscles again & eating healthy, you can help this along. You have to wait for your skin to rejuvenate underneath & be tight against your muscles. This takes time & lots of it!\nThat good ol’ muffin top – gotta love it! This is usually the last area that women finally notice shrinking, due in part to breastfeeding. Your body must hold onto some extra fat (usually a good 5-10 pounds for most) to produce good nutritious milk for your baby. So don’t get too carried away with the cardio & calorie burning just yet.\nAs soon as you stop breastfeeding, be sure you are super aware of your food intake. Instantly cut the extra sugar & high calorie food for several days so you don’t put weight back on. Pay close attention to how hungry you really are & that you’re not just eating because you’re used to eating so much food. Unless you instantly up your exercise at the same time you quit nursing you’ll actually gain weight.\n\n\n\nOh, and after each pregnancy it usually takes your body longer to recover. Keep up the hard work moms & take it day-by-day, incorporating exercise & healthy eating habits as much as you possibly can. Even small amounts of exercise can add up, so give it a go & do 10 minutes here & there if you can’t squeeze in an entire 30 plus minute workout!\nSign up here for my Newsletter so you don’t miss a thing!\nNow get moving with these 6 workouts I designed for Pregnancy & Newborn’s 6-week Postpartum Fitness Series!\n\nWeek 1 – Week 2 – Week 3 – Week 4 – Week 5 – Week 6 – DVD’s & Digital \nAre you giving yourself the time you should be?\n~Erica\nP.S.
