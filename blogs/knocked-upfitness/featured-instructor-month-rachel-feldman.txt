I love to do a full sun salutation, adding on to each vinyasa to increase the intensity and work up a sweat. Also, the Turkish get up with no weight which is challenging on its own! And squats of course!\nQ: What is the #1 thing you learned from Erica’s Prenatal and Postnatal Exercise Specialist course?\nA: The importance of releasing the pelvic floor. I spent so much time during my own pregnancy trying to keep my pelvic floor strong that when it actually came time to push I had a total mental and physical block. This course really taught me how to soften and release which I now teach to my clients.\nQ: What is your favorite inspirational quote?A: Sometimes clients will think if they can’t get to a class or work with a trainer that there’s no point in working out at all. But even if you can only get in five minutes at home on your own, that’s doing something. And every little bit helps.\nQ: Best pregnancy advice for all our pregnant mamas?\nA: Sleep! Whenever you can and whenever your body is telling you to. And listen to your intuition. Trust your instincts on what’s best for you and your growing baby. Don’t let other people’s opinions cloud what you know is best for yourself. \nQ: What was your favorite workout apparel you recommend to wear during the first trimester?\nA: Most Lululemon tops look like maternity wear to me! When I wasn’t ready to tell people but I had a little tummy, I wore all their billowy tops which nicely showcase your big growing boobs and cover your itty-bitty first-trimester bump!\nQ: What is your healthy go-to snack?\nA: Toasted Ezekiel bread with nut butter \nFor more information about Rachel and her training…\n\nVisit her website at… www.rachelfeldmanfitness.com\nEmail her at… rachelfeldmanfitness at gmail.com\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPrenatal & Postnatal Exercise Specialist Instructor Course\nErica Ziel’s Prenatal and Postnatal Exercise Specialist Instructor Course is designed to educate and teach fitness professionals how to safely and effectively train their prenatal and postnatal clients while maximizing their results.\nInstructors can expect to learn:\n\nHow to properly identify diastasis in their prenatal and postnatal clients\nInsight into the female anatomy, fascia and postural changes that happen during pregnancy and postpartum\nVariables, limitations and modifications that will affect each client differently\nHow pregnancy workouts have an impact on a woman’s labor, delivery and recovery\nHow to minimize, heal and prevent diastasis in your prenatal and postnatal clients\nHow to strengthen your client’s newly postpartum body for life as a busy mom\nPrenatal and postnatal case studies allowing you to apply what you have learned to real-life scenarios\nAnd MUCH MORE!\n\nClick here to learn more about Erica’s Prenatal and Postnatal Exercise Specialist Instructor Course.\nTo learn more about Erica Ziel and/or other programs she to offer, visit her website at www.ericaziel.com.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nShare:"
