"You probably don’t hear this very often, but pregnancy weight gain is actually a good thing! Unfortunately, it’s a topic that many women struggle with, especially when they are getting pressure from their medical provider. \n\n\n\nAnd with everything else that is going on during pregnancy, these conversations can hurt even more. But you want to know something? It’s okay to gain weight during pregnancy…In fact, you need to gain weight during pregnancy to keep you and baby healthy!\n\n\n\nYes, you heard me right: IT’S COMPLETELY HEALTHY TO GAIN WEIGHT DURING PREGNANCY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this video interview, I have a conversation with mom-to-be, Ally Bouchard, about gaining weight during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nAlly had an unfortunate experience where she felt unsupported by her OBGYN when she told her that she needs to stop gaining weight at 26-weeks pregnant. Because of medical opinions like this, women are scared of their hunger and that’s the worst thing to be afraid of while you’re pregnant. While you’re growing a baby, it’s important to be feeding your body with nourishing foods when it’s communicating to you.\n\n\n\nSo let’s start chatting about the myths that come with pregnancy weight gain…that gaining 25-40 pounds is what’s normal, that you should ignore what your body is trying to tell you, that it’s too late to switch doctors, that the weight is going to be hard to lose after having your baby. \n\n\n\nStop ignoring your hunger and start listening to your body.
