"So excited to officially announce ….I’m PREGNANT! \n\n\n\n\n13 weeks that is\n\n\n\n\nFinally! Felt like the 1st trimester would never end…you forget how awful morning sickness (or rather “all-day sickness”) is until you’re there again. Of course it’s all worth it but I feel this time around is a bit harder, probably because I’ve got 2 active ones I’m trying to keep up with which is challenging when my doc puts me on modified bedrest, boo 🙁\n\n\n\n\nThe modified bedrest which consisted of no walking, exercise, or sex (which well that wasn’t a huge deal to begin with since I felt like I was going to throw up any minute).  The reason being that I had  a 8-9cm cyst. I guess that’s  pretty big & they were concerned with it getting bigger & my ovary twisting which I’ve been told is more painful than labor (hard to imagine huh?). I’m happy to say the cyst is now down to 4cm, so I’m able to be more active but nothing like I was during my 1st 2 pregnancies. Thank goodness for my prenatal exercise knowledge 🙂\n\n\n\n\nI’ll keep you all updated from here on. \n\n\n\n\n~E\n\n]]>\t\t\nTags: 13 weeks, 2nd Trimester, Baby #3, erica, My Pregnancy, pregnancy, pregnancy complications, Real momsShare:"
