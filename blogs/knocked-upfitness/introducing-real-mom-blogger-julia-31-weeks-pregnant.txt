"Knocked-Up Fitness is excited to introduce Real Mom Blogger, Julia, who is 31 weeks into her third pregnancy! Running her dessert catering business can be tempting, but she’s found a way to balance some healthy eating habits, exercise, and the three other men in her life– her two boys and husband!\n \n\n \nQ: Tell us a little about yourself.\nA: I am 28 years old, and married to a fantastic man. We have 2 sons, 4 & 3, and I am currently 31 weeks pregnant. I homeschool the two boys as well as run a dessert catering business from home. I run the feeding ministry at church and am a tomboy through and through–(football, chainsaws, MMA, all of it)! And I am a super huge nerd our pet fish are all named after comic book super heroes and I know more about Marvel than my sons and husband combined.\nQ: What has your pregnancy experience been so far?\nA: I have partial placenta previa, an electrolyte deficiency that has caused me to pass out a couple times, heart burn to rival the burning of a thousand suns, and a pregnancy induced heart murmur. But the baby is super active and healthy, I have had no morning sickness, and my blood pressure has been good. So I’d say not too bad!\nQ: What are you most excited about with this pregnancy? Most nervous?\nA: The fact that I’m not ballooning and eating myself stupid. Most nervous about getting ready in time.\nQ: What are your favorite prenatal fitness activities?\nA: Walking to the library with my boys, Knocked Up Fitness online videos, and playing soccer in the backyard with my boys.\nQ: Any activities you’re finding more challenging or more enjoyable being your third pregnancy?\nA: I’m way more tired, not sure if it’s the fact that I’m almost 4 yrs older than the last time or if it’s keeping up with 2 whirling dervishes. Because I have not gained nearly as much weight as the last time, my feet, knees and back have held up much longer than the last 2 times.\nQ: You’re having your third boy! How are big brothers reacting to the pregnancy and thought of another brother?\nA: The oldest is a leader and very sensitive to people and their needs. He is excited to help and already says he wants to change diapers (we’ll see). He tells everyone we meet I’m having a baby, and keeps asking when he is coming– but he is upset about the name we picked, it wasn’t his choice from the list. The youngest is slightly less enthused. He thinks the baby will bite him and the only job he wants is to make funny faces if he cries. He is starting to warm up to the idea of being a big brother, as in his mind this means bossing the baby around.\nQ: Working in catering, are there any foods you’re having a hard time avoiding, or specific recipes you’re loving?\nA: I have a sweet tooth to start, so not licking every empty bowl is a challenge. I make an amazing pecan pie and have to fight the urge to bake one just for me on a frequent basis. We also do espresso and coffee catering, as I have a history of high blood pressure with pregnancy, so I have seriously cut back my caffeine intake. Grinding espresso beans and knowing I can’t make myself any is like some form of torture.\nQ: Any pregnancy cravings?\nA: Citrus/Tropical Fruits. I could eat my weight in peaches, pineapples, lemon or mango anything. Sweet Potatoes, and not a healthy version of them! And beer which is bizarre considering we don’t drink; every time I see a Sam Adams commercial I can smell that hoppy smell and I want one.\nQ: Do you have a favorite pregnancy super-food or go-to for a bit of a boost?\nA: Avocados. I love Mexican food and there are lots of ways to make it lighter and healthier. I love avocado and cilantro, it’s so clean and refreshing tasting.\nQ: Do you have a birth plan?\nA: I do. I am a control freak and a Type A personality, no way I’m going in without a plan.\nQ: What 3 words best describe the kind of mom you hope to be?\nA: Inspiring, Kind, and Fun\nQ: What is your favorite thing about pregnancy?\nA: The whole journey really. New developments each week, new movements, ultrasound sneak peeks, guessing, planning. I really love researching every facet of pregnancy, delivery, baby growth. I’m a nerd. If I were to put a 700th thing on my plate it would be to become a certified doula.\nQ: On the flip side; your least favorite thing?\nA: Having to ask for help. I’m extremely independent. I hate having to ask for help to move things, and at this stage help getting things I dropped off the floor.\nQ: What have you found most difficult to adjust to during pregnancy?\nA: Not being able to lift or carry my oldest son. He is 4 yrs old and built like a line backer already. He is in the 105th percentile for his height, making him almost 50-lbs but he is very snuggly and still wants to be held and carried to bed. Momma can’t do it.\nQ: Anything else you want to add?\nA: I’ve probably talked too much as it is! I’m notorious for doing that.\n \n*  *  *  *  *  *  *\nRelated Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\nIntroducing Real Mom Blogger Brittany, 33 weeks Pregnant\n\nPrenatal Visits: 9 Questions to Ask Your Doctor\n3 Exercises to Tighten & Tone Your Legs\n\n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 31 weeks, 3rd Trimester, Erica Ziel, Julianna, knocked-up fitness, pregnancy, pregnancy fitness, pregnancy health, pregnant, Real Mom Blog, Real moms, Real talk, stages of pregnancy, symptoms during pregnancy, week-by-week pregnancyShare:"
