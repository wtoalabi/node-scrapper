"You’ve probably heard that eating foods rich in Omega 3s are vital for pregnant women, kids and anyone seeking healthy hair, skin, eyes, heart, and neural development. What you may not know is that plant-based Omega 3s (called ALA) are not the same as marine sources of Omega 3s (EPA and DHA), like those found in Safe Catch Seafood.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe EPA and DHA found in fish is what provides the health benefits. Studies show that less than 1% of the ALA in plants converts to the vital EPA and DHA. Not all Omega 3s are the same!  \nSo, fish is really important for getting the good EPA and DHA Omega 3s, but what about mercury? Many doctors warn women ages 18-40 and kids to limit tuna and seafood consumption. But, the new guidance from the FDA and EPA says the bigger risk is not eating enough seafood due to its many nutrients, Omega 3s and health benefits.  The EPA and FDA guidance does say the best purity fish for pregnant women have mercury below a really strict standard of 0.15 parts per million.    \nWell, we are happy to tell you about a company called Safe Catch that has solved the mercury problem in salmon and tuna and created a more nutritious product with less processing.  Safe Catch invented technology to test every single fish to really strict mercury limits and they are the only brand that tests each fish. About one out of three fish do not pass Safe Catch strict mercury limits and their average for Safe Catch Elite Tuna is about 5 times lower the best level set by the FDA for pregnant women!  \nSafe Catch has designed a specialty canned tuna and canned salmon that is 100% safe for pregnant women and everyone plus, tastes better and has more nutrients due to less processing! Great for kids and even babies when first introducing finger foods. Did you know that salmon is a wonderful and healthy finger food for babies too? Dr. Bob Sears recommends introducing salmon to babies around 9-12 months of age.\nSafe Catch is the ONLY brand that tests every single fish for mercury, and their product is an average of 20x lower in mercury than the FDA standard!! \nWhile other varieties of canned seafood lose their Omega-3 potency during processing, Safe Catch hand cuts and packs their product. Using their artisan cooking process, Safe Catch’s fish retains all oils and nutrients – the stuff that is good for you AND baby, so don’t dump the juices in their cans! Eat it!!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThis is such a huge advantage for moms who want to make nutrition a priority, without having to spend a ton of time preparing their meals. The FDA suggests pregnant women and children be especially mindful of seafood consumption, choosing low mercury options, and getting 2-3 servings of fish per week (FDA, 2017).
