"I want to share with you one of my favorite pregnancy exercises the Mermaid Stretch! You’ll find this exercise throughout many of my workouts and discussed in my training program and for good reason, plus my clients LOVE them – they are an exceptionally amazing exercise.\n\nHere are my top 5 tips for why you should include Mermaid Stretch into your workouts:\n\nCould help with round ligament pain and discomfort\nCan help to stretch your tight belly {especially during those growth spurts} which could help in minimizing diastasis recti\nGreat for stretching your hips and chest\nFeels amazing on your back and side\nHelps to encourage deep diaphragmatic breathing\n\n\nMermaid Stretch {do 2 to 4 reps on one side then switch}\n\n\n\n\n\nSeated with your right leg bent in front and left leg tucked behind, right hand on the ground behind your body. Exhale as you press with your glutes while reaching your left-hand overhead, pressing your hips up, bringing you up onto your knees.\nInhale to lower down placing your hips back on the ground.\n\nModification: If you find it challenging to sit in this position grab a pillow to place under your hips!\nIn need of a visual explanation?
