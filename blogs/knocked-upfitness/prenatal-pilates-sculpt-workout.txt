"I founded Knocked-Up Fitness in 2012, the year Rihanna had us shining bright like a Diamond and Facebook went public.\n\n\n\nMy, how times have changed…Did I know that I would be helping thousands of mamas through my online membership prepare their bodies for pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum recovery? No. Not at all.\n\n\n\nBut no matter what single Rihanna released that year, one thing that remained the same was that I kept showing up to educate and support my clients along every step of their motherhood journey.\n\n\n\n*They are the why behind why I do what I do.*\n\n\n\nTo this day, I continue to create workouts, guides, and podcast episodes to empower you to make the right decisions for your body.\n\n\n\nWhat can I say? Knowledge is POWER.\n\n\n\n>>Because movement is my thing, I wanted to share with you this Pilates Sculpt workout from our Knocked-Up Fitness Membership.<<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless if you’re in your first, second, or third trimester, these moves will strengthen your deep core while activating your pelvic floor.\n\n\n\nClick >>HERE<< to try them for yourself and get your body moving, mama!\n\n\n\nOnce you finish this pilates sculpt, you’re probably going to wonder why it’s important to have a movement practice during your pregnancy, right?
