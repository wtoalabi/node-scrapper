"I never was much for maternity clothes and for those of you who know me, know I LOVEÂ  lululemon clothes! Itâ€™s just so hard for me to move past & try something new.\n\n\nTurning back the clock to my pregnant days, well not really that long ago â€™cause they are only 20 months & almost 4 yrs. but things change so fast and time must be going fasterâ€¦\nIt was obvious that I just couldnâ€™t keep wearing my current Lululemon pants, the groove pant but must move onto something that wouldnâ€™t make me realize just how much I was really growing & expanding! Adding to that I also needed pants I could wear to work as a trainer and also wear out to dinner. Maternity stores just werenâ€™t for me then, so lululemon it was.\n\n\nLululemonâ€™s STILL PANT, turned out to by my favorite maternity pant. Very comfortable yet looked nice so I felt comfortable wearing them anywhere and could dress them up with a nicer shirt. Black was my color of choice. The Still Pant for your pregnancy is well worth every penny ðŸ™‚\n\n\n\n\nI have to add more to the maternity pants topic about how thereâ€™s more options out there now. I checked out Xpecting Maternity Boutique the other day and was very impressed with new styles & functional jeans, specifically Paige Maternity Denim, they have adjustable elastic built-in to the waist band just like kids pants, Genius if you ask me!\n\n\n\n\nIâ€™ll be purchasing those if thereâ€™s ever a baby #3 ðŸ˜‰\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever pants you buy during pregnancy be sure they are comfortable & you have room to grow & donâ€™t forget about your hips. I hate to say it but those hips will expand, they have too, keep up your exercise during & after pregnancy & chances are in time they will return to normal.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n~E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]>\t\t\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester, Erica Ziel, Favorites, knocked-up fitness, Legs, lululemon, maternity clothes, mom products, My Favorites, oprah, pregnancy, products, Real moms, week-by-week pregnancy, xpecting materntiyShare:"
