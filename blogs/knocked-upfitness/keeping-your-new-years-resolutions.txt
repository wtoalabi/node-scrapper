"As we near the end of January many of you may find yourself starting to slip away from your new years resolutions already – yikes! So let’s take a new look at those resolutions – or as I like to call them “goals”. Creating resolutions may just seem like to big a task to actually accomplish. Instead, let’s make goals that you will actually be able to accomplish and feel amazing doing so!\n \n\nBy all means shoot for the stars! Figure out your BIG goal – write it down – then let’s figure out what 2-5 things you need to actively do to reach your BIG goal. It’s about action! Find those action items – write them down.\n \nFor me this year I really want to do more yoga – not just learn it – but do yoga for me…I teach a lot (pilates and strength training mostly) and believe it or not sometimes I just want someone else to tell me what to do. Instead of me having to always think about what move or exercise comes next (because I do that ALL the time).\n \n \n\n \n \nIn order for me to do more yoga I have to figure out where to fit it into my busy life of training, building a biz, oh and yes, I have 3 kids and an amazing hubby that fill up every ounce of time I’m home. So for me I have a couple options:\n\nDo yoga at home – which is great when I’m at home all day with the kiddos plus they get to see me be active and they love to join in too! Really a great option for you busy mamas that don’t have time to go to the gym. I do understand that sometimes after you’ve spent all day running around after them and/or working the thought of actually “working out” is exhausting…but even 10 minutes on a regular basis can make a BIG difference and you are setting a wonderful example for your little ones!\nFind a class to attend – many of my favorite yoga instructors teach at the same time I do, so typically I must go in an evening when hubby’s home to watch the kiddos. I love my evenings with my family so this one’s challenging, but I’ll go if that ends up being my only option for the week because my hubby and I make it a priority for us both to get our workouts in on an almost daily basis…Sometimes you just have to schedule your workouts in, even if they aren’t the most convenient.\nSqueeze in some yoga between clients at the gym – honestly this is my most “realistic” option since I’m already in the gym and in the “workout” mindset. But then there’s the reformer and weights…lots of choices J I know for many of you this isn’t an option because your not in a gym all day – but, you can use your breaks, baby’s naptime or lunch break during the day to squeeze in even a short workout.\n\n \nHmmm….just too much to do and so little time…but I really am trying to do more yoga this year and I wanted to share with you 8 of my favorite yoga poses in my new Target® C9 workout gear!\n \nWhich, I can happily say fits me really well and I’m comfortable wearing the Target® C9 workout wear all day. That’s saying a lot since I live in workout clothes. There was no pulling or tugging on any of the three pieces (especially the pants, I was super happy with the fit!) – plus what’s not to love because it’s affordable! I bought all three pieces for $65 at my local Target®! $65 for three articles of clothing – seriously, for real? That’s less than I’ve paid in the past for a typical pair of pants that’s in my closet right now. Super impressed!\n \n\n \nPremium Capri Legging ($34.99) @ Target®\nRibbed Tank ($7.78) @ Target®\nMedium Support Compression Sports Bra ($16.99) @ Target®\n \nI also found a couple maternity tops online for you pregnant mamas:  Maternity Tank ($22.99) &  Maternity Halter Fit & Flare Tank ($24.99)\n \nAlways listen to your body and be sure your physician has approved you for exercise. I added “Pregnant?” with an answer for each exercise and “Modify” with modifications for each exercise. If an exercise doesn’t feel good for your body – don’t do it. Find the modification or focus on the exercises you can do and as you become stronger you’ll be able to do more (a couple exercises are more challenging and NOT for pregnancy). I love yoga but during pregnancy I recommend focusing on strength and stability and be cautious to avoid over-stretching. Stretches should feel good and never painful. \n \n\nDown Dog\nPregnant? Love for pregnancy, be sure they feel good for you as your pregnancy progresses. Replace with Cat Cows once they no longer feel good for you.\nModify – bend your knees to allow your lower back to flatten.\n \n \n\nDown Dog Twist\nPregnant? Can do early on but recommend avoiding later on in pregnancy.\n \n \n\nSingle Leg Bridge\nPregnant? A great exercise during pregnancy as long as you feel good on your back.\nModify – keep both feet on the ground.\n\n \n \n\nTree\nPregnant? A great exercise during pregnancy.\nModify – use a chair or something stable to hang onto to help you balance.\n \n \n\nWarrior 2\nPregnant? Love warrior 2 for pregnancy, a great exercise to help open up your hips.\nModify – avoid going so low.\n \n \nTriangle\nPregnant? Can do if it feels good for you but I recommend modifying. Replace with warrior 2 once this no longer feels good.\nModify – Use a block for your back hand.\n \n \n\nShoulder Stand\nPregnant? I recommend avoiding unless you are completely comfortable doing this before pregnancy and it feels good for you now.\n \n \n\nBow\nPregnant? AVOID – you cannot do this during pregnancy. But it’s great after to help open up your tight chest and strengthen your back.\n \nThe reality of it is that I’m aiming for 1 yoga session every week – now that might not sound like a lot but since I already do pilates and lift weights regularly and run occasionally, adding yoga is actually a challenge for me. But a good challenge for me because I always feel amazing after – all the more reason for me to do it. And you too! When we strive for something that is challenging it will make us stronger (both physically and mentally).\n \nSo what’s your new years BIG goal and how are you going to achieve it?\n \n\n \nThis post was sponsored by Target® through their partnership with POPSUGAR Select.
