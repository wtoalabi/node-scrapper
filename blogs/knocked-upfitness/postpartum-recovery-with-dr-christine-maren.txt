"Listen closely ladies: postpartum recovery is not limited to one year after having your baby.\n\n\n\nI know so many of us are convinced that you are no longer considered postpartum after one year of having baby. AND some of you even strive to reach that one-year mark because it’s thought that all postpartum symptoms will just go away. I mean, that would just make our lives easier right? BUT…postpartum recovery AND postpartum health aren’t that simple.\n\n\n\nI invited board-certified physician, Dr. Christine Maren, on the Core Connections podcast to teach you how to thrive postpartum and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of learning to live with the “new normal”, you CAN take control of your postpartum recovery!  Becoming your own health advocate, learning new lifestyle habits and wellness practices can make a drastic improvement in how you feel physically, mentally and emotionally! \n\n\n\nLadies, being aware, being knowledgable and being on top of your health can allow you not only heal symptoms in your body but prevent them from ever happening.\n\n\n\nSo this is Dr. Maren and I sharing our knowledge with you…not only as women’s health professionals but as moms who want you to get your life back to thriving postpartum + beyond.\n\n\n\nIf you’re ready to hear how to find better solutions, plug-in those headphones and take a listen.
