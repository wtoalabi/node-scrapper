"I know life get’s busy and it can be more than challenging to find the time to cook and eat healthy -but here’s the thing, it doesn’t have to be! That’s why I created my 21-day program “Healthy Lifestyle for the Busy Mom”, because being healthy doesn’t have to be hard and because there are so many other aspects to health I also dive into those too, the balance is important for our overall health!\nMany of the recipes in the program make great leftovers (and that’s saying something coming from me who really isn’t much for eating leftovers). Plus each day you receive an email that has a specific topic, some nutrition related, many not, along with workout assignments each day, and yes there are workout options for you pregnant mamas! It’s a great balance of healthy eating (for the entire family), creating other healthy lifestyle habits, and exercising (even just a little) each day.\nI want to share with you a favorite recipe {and one that’s from the program}, Citrus Tacos. The key to this recipe is having leftover slaw to add to your meal the following day, and of course you can prepare additional fish as well.\n\nCitrus Slaw {the key ingredient for the Citrus Tacos}\nMakes enough for 4 tacos or 2 to 4 servings on it’s own. Great paired with grilled Ono.\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup thinly sliced green cabbage\n½ cup thinly sliced red cabbage\n½ red, yellow, or orange sweet bell pepper diced\n½ small red onion, sliced into thin strips\n¼ cup of fresh basil, chopped\n2 tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped\n1 large orange peeled and sectioned\n1 tbsp olive oil\n¼ tsp garlic salt\n¼ tsp sea salt\n1/8 black pepper\n1 fresh squeezed lime\n\n \n \n \n\nOptional:\n\n½ to 1 avocado, diced – goes great with fish or chicken tacos\n2 to 4 tbsp mayo – makes it a creamy citrus slaw, goes great with grilled fish\n\nPreparation:\n\nCombine everything into a large bowl and refrigerate.\nIf adding avocado add right before serving.\n\nRefrigerate. Best if eaten fresh within 2-3 days of making.\n\nTags: 21-day program, family friendly recipe, favorite recipe, gluten free, Healthy Lifestyle, Nutrition, recipe, Recipes, tacos, Weight LossShare:"
