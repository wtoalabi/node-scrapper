"Here we are: week 34 and things just got even more interesting!\n\nI have been diagnosed with polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid), which they suspect may be from gestational diabetes that was missed in the 1-hour glucose test. The polyhydramnios makes me high risk for preterm delivery, and I have been instructed to “take it easy”.\nNo more squats with dumbbells for me, but luckily no one uttered the dreaded words bed rest. My new go to exercises are the 3 butt lifting exercises (just because my belly is sagging, doesn’t mean my butt has to) and the tricep extensions. I’ve also been doing a lot of Wii boxing and stretching. The stretching should come in handy, since I plan on doing a medication free, all natural delivery and in the level II ultrasound we had yesterday the baby weighed in at 6lbs 14oz already!\n\n\nI haven’t had the 3-hour test yet, but in an effort to get out in front of this thing I’ve begun to cut back on my sugars and carbs. So what’s a baker to do with herself in the midst of the carby-est time of the year. Well suck it up for starters and then you get creative. Just last night my two sons, 3 and 4, really wanted spaghetti. Regular pasta has a really high glycemic index, no good if you are trying to watch your sugar level. Instead Mommy made herself Eggs in Purgatory. Sounds strange, tastes delicious. Here’s how it goes:\n \n\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n2 cups of your favorite jarred pasta sauce (read the label to make sure your sauce isn’t high in sugar)\n\n\n2 eggs\n\n\n2 slices of provolone\n\n\n2 slices of your favorite low carb or high fiber bread (rye and Ezekiel bread or breads with more than 5 grams of fiber per serving are considered to have a low glycemic index)\n\n\n \nInstructions:\n\n\nPut your sauce in a small pan and heat until bubbling. If your sauce is thick you may want to add a tablespoon or so of water which will evaporate out as you cook. Crack your two eggs into the pasta sauce and cover with a lid. Start toasting your bread. Let it bubble for 5 minutes by which time the whites should be firm, but keep an eye out the last thing you want is rubbery eggs. The hot sauce will have poached the eggs, how cool is that.\n\n\nPlace your toast on the plate, top with your poached egg, the hot sauce and a slice of provolone and enjoy! This meal is so tasty and comforting it won’t feel like you’re depriving yourself at all.\n\n\n \n\n\nJust 6 weeks left…maybe. Here’s to avoiding the jello pudding and the jello booty!\n\n\n–Julia–\n\n\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *\nSign up for the exclusive Knocked-Up Fitness Newsletter!\nRelated Knocked-Up Fitness Posts:\n\n7 Pregnancy Super Foods\n\nPOPSUGAR Live! 4 At-Home Prenatal & Postpartum Exercises\n\nHealthy Eats Tips During Pregnancy & Breastfeeding\n\n \n\nTags: 1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 34 weeks, 3rd Trimester, Erica Ziel, healthy food for pregnancy, healthy nutrition for pregnant women, healthy pregnancy eating, Julianna, knocked-up fitness, pregnancy, pregnancy fitness, pregnancy health, pregnant, pregnany nutrition, Real Mom Blog, Real moms, Real talk, stages of pregnancy, symptoms during pregnancy, week-by-week pregnancyShare:"
