"I believe that knowledge is power.\n\n\n\nSince college, I’ve always had my nose buried in a book so I can continue to enhance the lives of my pregnant and postpartum clients. I used to spend hours at night losing myself in a prenatal page-turner.\n\n\n\nAfter seeing the information that was out there, I knew I had to create a resource so expecting mamas can have a healthier pregnancy.\n\n\n\nI’m happy to report that all of those late nights of reading paid off and I became a published author sharing a step-by-step guide on how to prepare the pregnant body for an easier delivery and faster recovery.\n\n\n\n*I was able to make my unique way of training available for moms everywhere!*\n\n\n\nOnce I finally got my book published, I couldn’t stop.\n\n\n\nSo I decided to bring my book to life by creating the Knocked-Up Fitness online prenatal membership! But like I said, I believe that knowledge is power…so you can still find me today getting lost in the pages of countless pregnancy books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could go on and on about the countless pregnancy books I’ve read to better the health of myself and my clients, but if I had to narrow it down, these would be my top ten favorite books for mothers (in alphabetical order):\n\n\n\nThe First Forty Days: The Essential Art of Nourishing the New Mother by Heng OuGood Moms Have Scary Thoughts: A Healing Guide to the Secret Fears of New Mothers by Karen KleimanIna May’s Guide to Childbirth by Ina May GaskinThe Mama Natural Week-by-Week Guide to Pregnancy and Childbirth by Genevieve HowlandMayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy by The Pregnancy Experts at Mayo ClinicOverwhelmed: How to Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time by Brigid SchulteReal Food for Pregnancy: The Science and Wisdom of Optimal Prenatal Nutrition by Lily NicholsThe Better Baby Book: How to Have a Healthier, Smarter, Happier Baby by Lana Asprey and David AspreyThe Knocked-Up Fitness Guide to Pregnancy by Erica ZielThe Whole-Brain Child: 12 Revolutionary Strategies to Nurture Your Child’s Developing Mind by Daniel J.
