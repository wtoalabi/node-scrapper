"Stop Butt Tucking Already!\nYou may be wondering what I mean by that…\nThe truth is, almost every new client that comes to me the first thing I work on is posture and this includes getting him/her to stop tucking their butt!!!!\nNo wonder everyone has back problems, core dysfunction, neck pain and on and on. Yes, believe it or not, if you tuck your butt that could be the source {or part of the source} of where the pain is coming from. For many, where you actually feel your pain isn’t usually where the source of the cause of the pain is coming from.\n\nYou still with me? Okay, I started going off a bit but really it’s all connected and by ‘untucking your butt’ your body will thank you!! It’s no easy task, so give your body time and patience because change takes both of those.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tImprove Your Core Connection!\nYes, untucking your butt and getting your pelvis to align properly can allow your deep core muscles to connect more effectively.\nWhich means:\n\nimproved core strength\nbetter posture\nfewer aches and pains\nmore support of your pelvis\nstart healing diastasis recti\nimprove prolapse\nand even add length to your spine!\n\nAre you convinced yet?\nPregnant Mamas: One last thing, postural changes during pregnancy can actually encourage your pelvis to tuck under. I know, annoying right! But by being aware of that postural shift, you can work on minimizing your butt tucking and encourage proper posture and alignment as your pregnancy progresses.\nThat is why I created my Prenatal + Postnatal Membership! In the membership, I work with mamas to help with all those bullet points above and so much more!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nTags: back pain, back pain during pregnancy, back pain in pregnancy, butt tuck, butt tucking, butt winking, Core, Diastasis Recti, get rid of bak pain, glute release, hip pain, how to prevent low back pain, low back pain, Pelvic Floor, posterior pelvis, posterior pelvis tiltShare:"
