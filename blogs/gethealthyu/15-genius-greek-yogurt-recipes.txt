Not only does it taste indulgent on its own, you can also cook/bake with it in so many recipes. It’s great swapped in for sour cream, blended in smoothies, layered in parfaits and so much more. Plus, it’s packed with tons of nutrition such as probiotics, protein, and calcium. From breakfast to dinner, below are 15 of our favorite (and delicious!) ways to eat Greek yogurt:\nGreek Yogurt Benefits\nGreek yogurt is thicker and creamier than regular yogurt as it’s been strained to remove the majority of it’s liquid whey, lactose and sugar. It’s packed with twice the amount of protein as regular yogurt and is typically less in sugar. It also is higher in probiotics, so it definitely should make your list of super foods. It’s a great substitution for a protein shake or a serving of meat (6 ounces of Greek Yogurt has 15-20 grams of protein; this is equivalent to 2-3 ounces of meat or poultry).
