Focus on Overall Weight Loss; Not Spot Reducing\nThe most common misconception about weight loss that is still floating around out there: spot-reducing.\nScience says you can’t spot reduce body fat. That means you can’t pick a spot on your body and exercise the fat away. You see, you store fat cells all over your body. Where your fat cells happen to be more concentrated is often a genetic predisposition.\nHaving arm fat doesn’t mean you can lose the fat directly from your arms alone. It means you have to first lose body fat all over and then work on specifically strengthening your arms to tone them the way you wish.\nIn other words, just doing a bunch of exercises for your arms isn’t enough. Strong toned arms won’t look any different if they are still covered in a layer of fat. You need to lose the fat AND tone the arms.\n4. Get Your Cardio In\n\n\n\n\n\nCardiovascular exercise is known to help burn calories and eliminate body fat, so don’t skimp on your cardio! More importantly, make sure your cardio minutes are effective.\n60 minutes on an elliptical reading a book is not going to be as effective as 20 minutes of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). That doesn’t mean you can’t be on the elliptical, just be sure to make your time worthwhile!\nWhen performing cardio, you want to make sure you are working hard enough to breathe through your mouth and make you think about what you’re doing. If you can multi-task during the workout, it’s time to change it up!\nShoot for 4-5 days a week of effective cardio training! And if walking is your cardio of choice, check out our plan 3 Walking Workouts to Boost Your Weight Loss.\n5. Sleep\nYou know sleeping is important, but did you know that sleep and weight loss share an important link? There are a few reasons why you need to make sure you’re getting adequate sleep while working to lose arm fat.\nThe first is that when we’re overtired, we tend to reach for added calories in the form of sugary, caffeinated beverages or processed snacks. Ever hit a wall at work at 3 pm? What do you do? Grab a coffee and candy bar. Two things that will not serve you well when you’re trying to lose weight. Plus, a tired brain actually has a harder time saying no to cravings.\nThe other reason is that when you’re low on sleep, you’re cortisol level spikes leading your body to store fat (leading to extra arm fat). Opposite of what you’re trying to accomplish!\n6. Increase Water\nDrinking water is key for weight loss. It contains zero calories, boosts your metabolism, aids the body in efficient removal of waste, and can even decrease your appetite. Drink a big glass of water prior to your meals and you may just find yourself more satisfied and eating less.\nAnd be sure to cut out soda, juice and alcohol. That’s right—eliminate alcohol as much as possible while trying to lose arm fat. You don’t want the empty calories and it won’t make losing weight any easier.\nOn average, you should be drinking at least 8-10 glasses of water a day. If you exercise regularly, add another glass or two to that.\n7. Develop a Morning Routine\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hardest part of losing weight can often be keeping motivated. Developing a consistent routine is key and the most consistent exercisers tend to work out in the morning. The benefits of morning workouts are pretty awesome:\n\nConsistency: It’s rare that a meeting or conference call can be called at 6:00 a.m., so interruptions aren’t likely.\nHormones: The hormones that help you build muscle and burn fat are at their peak early in the morning, making early workouts more efficient.\nEating Better: Morning exercisers choose a healthier breakfast and studies show that those who start with a healthy breakfast eat better all day long.\nBetter Sleep: Morning exercisers tend to fall asleep more quickly and sleep better through the night.\nEnergy: Morning exercise gives you more energy throughout the day. You might think you’d be more tired, but the opposite is true.\n\nHere are a few tips to develop a morning routine.\nREMEMBER, you can change the shape of your arms as you lose the fat and work on arm strength exercises designed to tone and shape your biceps, triceps and shoulders.\nWhen all of these things are happening, the arm fat begins to be replaced with toned, shapely arms.\nClick here to get your free download!\nREAD THIS NEXT: Top 6 Moves To Prevent Flabby Arms"
