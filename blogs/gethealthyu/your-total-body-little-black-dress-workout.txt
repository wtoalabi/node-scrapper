"How about slipping into that party dress with a little more confidence? While it may be unrealistic to lose a bunch of weight before you head to your next holiday get-together, you CAN slip in a quick workout to help you look more toned, feel energized and carry more confidence with every step.\nWe’ve all seen the fitness models toned and sculpted in their tanks or the shirtless guy selling cologne. Well here’s a little secret—they worked out right before those pictures were taken! That’s right. The “pump” you get from lifting weights is real. Immediately after lifting weights, the muscle fibers experience micro-tears and begin to break down. This is, of course, how you become stronger. Once broken down your muscles build back stronger than they were before but in the short term, the torn fibers get a rush of blood and water to help begin the repair process thereby defining your muscles and making you look more toned and strong. Now while we can’t promise you that “model-like” body, you WILL look more toned, feel more energized and be more confident than ever. So let’s get this party started!\nTotal-Body LBD Workout\nThis workout takes about 15 minutes and should be done right before you shower and dress for your event.

And although we are suggesting this workout before you head to your event, for even better results, do this workout three times a week.
