"There’s something irresistible about carbs—the way they soak up flavors of sauces, spices and ooey gooey cheese. All on their own, a slice of bread, a ribbon of pasta is enough to make you do a food dance. The downside, however, is that not all carbs are created equal, and many ought to be left to the occasional indulgent comfort food category. But good carbs can be great, and shouldn’t be overlooked as a healthy supplement to your daily diet. So, when comfort is calling your name, why not opt for healthier versions like cauliflower?\nCauliflower is coming in hot for its health benefits, versatility and, of course, yumminess. The cruciferous vegetable is incredibly nutrient dense, offering large quantities of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other phytochemicals. The vegetable contains several compounds that have been shown to fight cancer and boost brain health thanks to its good source of choline, which is a B vitamin known for its role in brain development. Cauliflower also helps the body’s ability to detoxify too, as it contains antioxidants that support Phase 1 detoxification, and sulfur-containing nutrients crucial for Phase 2 detox activities. Cauliflower contains glucosinolates that also activate detoxification enzymes. Researchers have found that sulforaphane made from a glucosinolate in cauliflower can help protect the lining of your stomach as well, making the vegetable beneficial for digestive health.\n\n \nCauliflower also happens to be the perfect substitute for things like pasta, potatoes, bread and more without sacrificing deliciousness, so let’s dig into some of the most scrumptious meals where cauliflower shines as a replacement for carbs.
