Traditional squats are great for building strength and toning the butt and legs, but adding a plyometric element (the jump) will help you build more muscle and burn more fat. Additionally, balancing your body weight during this move is a major challenge for your abs, allowing you to build strength and stability through your core.\nRelated: 14 Days To A Better Butt Challenge\nKick Through Lunge\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from all the benefits from a regular lunge (glutes, legs) this move adds core strength and a balance challenge by kicking the leg through and ending up standing on one leg with the other leg extended out in front.  In addition, you will use your core stability to bring the leg behind you again and land back in a lunge position. You also use a slightly larger range of motion (up and down) than a traditional lunge, so you are adding more heart rate and cardio challenge to the strength benefits.\n \nCross-Behind Lunge\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of the cross behind lunge as more of a single leg squat. In essence, the leg that drops behind you should not bear any weight. You focus all of your weight on the leg in front, bending that knee and feeling the squeeze in the glute. I addition,  core strength is used to keep you standing in a tall position as you sweep your leg behind you and bend the front knee.\nPistol Squat\n\n\n\n\n\nPistol squat is a version of a single leg squat. In this version, you extend the non-squat leg out in front of you in order to keep the weight of your body focused on your glute muscle in the standing leg. This leg also promotes good posture during the squat\nStiletto Squat \n\n\n\n\n\nThis version of a squat focuses on all of the same traditional squat muscles of the legs and glutes and also adds calf work by lifting the heels as you lower and lift your body. In addition you work core stability due to the balance needed for this move.\nSide Lunge\n\n\n\n\n\nThe side lunge strengthens and tones the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. Inner thighs are notorious problem areas for so many people, and these squats target that area AND help to shape and lift your booty. Because this variation has you going side-to-side instead of the traditional up-and-down, you’ll be targeting your inner and outer thighs more effectively. This variation is also much easier on the knees, so it’s great for anyone who struggles with a knee injury or knee pain!\nSplit Jumps\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit jumps are another plyometric exercise that target your lower body, fire up your heart rate and allow you to torch calories and fat more quickly than a traditional stationary lunge or squat would. This particular variation is a blend between strength training and cardio, engages your core, and will help tone up that lower body, one jump at a time!\nREAD THIS NEXT: No Squat, No Lunge, Better Booty Workout"
