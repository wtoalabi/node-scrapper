"If you’re a bigger busted gal on the hunt for the perfect sports bra, the road isn’t always easy. Either the sports bras aren’t nearly supportive enough, they look like they were made for your grandmother, or they simply aren’t available in your size. We’ve been there, and as all of you well-endowed athletes and gym-goers know, the right sports bra can make or break any workout, sports game, or physical activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n“After my first child was born, I was dying to get out running again. He was six weeks old (now 25 years old) and I decided to give it a try. Besides the fact I wasn’t back to my fighting shape, for the first time in my life I understood what you Double D’s are talking about. Forget the side stitch on my left side, my post partum inflated breasts were bouncing everywhere and it was painful. I had tried the old “ace bandage wrap” thinking that would help since I didn’t have a sports bra that fit at the moment, and my normal size is a large B. But I now understand what you mean when you say you need support. I have several friends who used to complain (in our younger years) about the lack of selection for the well endowed. But the good news is, we’ve come a long way, baby! There is a huge (no pun intended) variety of options. You no longer have to avoid high impact exercise. The support you need is available.” – Chris\nChris is exactly right, there is a solution! The fitness apparell world has caught wind of this massive issue and there are now numerous companies with wide selections of supportive, attractive, FUNCTIONAL sports bras for all you D+ girls out there.\n \nSports Bra Must-Haves\n\n\n\n\nFor women with bigger boobs, there are a few reasons why the right sports bra is a total game-changer. First, a truly supportive sports bra made for women with larger breasts is going to offer a level of comfort and support that typical sports bras may not. A supportive sports bra is going to be your best friend during any physical activity, whether you’re running, weight lifting, or doing yoga. The next reason is that a supportive, well-fitting sports bra will prevent sagging (while helping lift!). Breast tissue is supported by both skin and a series of ligaments called “Cooper’s Ligaments.” During physical activity, these Cooper’s Ligaments can stretch out if not properly supported, leading to “drooping” or “sagging” breasts. Enter: truly supportive sports bras to save the day.\nWhen you have bigger boobs, the quality of your sports bra is so important. The support and fit we’ve discussed is something offered by sports bras made with bustier active women in mind.  The best way to find the right one is by doing your research and understanding what your specific needs are. First things first, you need to remember that your sports bra needs will vary according to four things:\n\nYour cup size\nThe circumference around your upper rib cage\nYour personal preferences,\nAnd the activity you are doing.\n\nAlthough your needs will vary according to your cup size, the circumference around your upper rib cage, your personal preferences, and the activity you are doing, there are some important things to look for in every sports bra.\n\nA sports bra should fit snugly, but not constrict breathing. If the bra cuts into your skin, it’s too small. If it is bunching, has gaps or is wrinkling, it’s too big.\nSecurity is key. To get the support you want, “the girls” should barely move when you jog in place.\nSeek out designers who design with YOU in mind. Use specialty stores because they have sports bras designed specifically for exercise enthusiasts and athletes.\nGet moisture-wicking fabric! To prevent chafing, look for moisture-wicking fabrics and look for bras that are seamless or have covered seams. Moisture-wicking fabrics also offer the bonus of keeping you cooler as you exercise.\nCotton is not your friend. Stay away from sports bras that are 100 percent cotton, because as you sweat, the bras will get wet and stay wet.\n\n \nThe Best Supportive Sports Bras for Large Cup Sizes:\n \nAthleta\nAthleta makes it easy to choose sports bras based on activity level; their high-impact bras are great for HIIT training, interval classes, or any other time where you need maximum support. Plus, they come in a wide range of styles, colors and fabrics so you have plenty to choose from.\nWe recommend the Performance Underwire Bra. This one has a back enclosure, which allows for more secure support than bras that have to fit over your head and shoulders. It comes complete with underwire and allows for some serious compression, all while preventing the dreaded uniboob.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Performance Underwire Bra | Available at Athleta\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nEnell.com \nEnell Inc. provides well-endowed women with the opportunity to fully participate in an active lifestyle with high quality performance apparel.

It has 3 hook and eye closures in the back and padded adjustable straps with no elastic to enhance the “girls” bounce. I undo the straps to put it on and then flip it up to adjust as it can be a bit of a struggle otherwise but I will no longer run in any other bra.” – Kelly\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n“Check out the nearest Lane Bryant store for Cacique bras. I have joint problems, and the “pull it over your head” type got me in some difficult spots. Cacique has larger sizes as well as front closure with zippers and traditional snaps. I bought a sports bra (40D) that closes like a traditional bra and I love it. My next sports bras will come from Cacique. Oh, and they’re online, too.” – Mary\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n \n“I am a size 8-10/36DDD.  I used to wear 2-3 bras to run or any other moderate activity.
