"This post is from our friends at Slender Kitchen.\nLet’s be honest, while we all have the best intentions when it comes to cooking up healthy meals, many times life just gets in the way. Between busy work days, afterschool activities, running errands, cleaning up, and hopefully squeezing in some exercise, it’s hard to find the time to shop, plan, and cook a healthy meal. So we end up reaching for take–out, processed food, or the same boring chicken breast we have eaten ten times in the past two weeks.\nSo this week, instead of making meals a last–minute afterthought, you need a plan. A healthy meal plan that will not only make dinnertime easy and stress–free, but will help you reach your weight loss and healthy living goals.\nTo get you started, make these two healthy breakfast recipes on Sunday and then enjoy them all week long, alternating every morning so you don’t get bored. Then plan to make these quick and easy dinners during the week. Plan on cooking up a little extra so you have leftovers for lunches—using them in big healthy salads, wraps, tacos, or grain bowls. And if you really want to get ahead, cut and prep your veggies and cook your grains on Sunday for even faster weekday cooking.\nThat’s all it takes! One simple meal plan for a week of delicious and healthy eating. So go get cooking and eat well all week.\n\n\nAsparagus and Mushroom Quinoa Frittatas served with fresh fruit\n\n\nOvernight Brownie Batter Oatmeal\n\n\nSlow Cooker Sweet and Spicy Chicken Thighs with brown rice and your favorite veggie\n\n\nBalsamic Chicken with Mushrooms and Thyme with quinoa (leftover from the frittatas)\n\n\nThai Basil Ground Beef Bowl\n\n\nBlackened Salmon with a baked sweet potato and veggie\n\n\nGreek Black Olive and Feta Burgers with Baked Skinny Fries and light English muffins for buns and a side green salad\n\n\nAnd here’s what you’ll need from the store (for 4 servings per recipe)\nSlender Kitchen Shopping List\n\n\n\n\n\nDairy & Refrigerated\n8 eggs\n1/2 cup reduced fat milk\n1.5 oz. reduced fat feta cheese\n2.5 cups nonfat plain Greek yogurt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeat\n1.33 lbs. boneless skinless chicken thighs\n24 oz. wild salmon\n1.33 lbs. 95% lean ground beef\n1 lb. 99% lean ground turkey\n1.33 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breast tenderloins\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduce\nGarlic\n1 onion\n1 red onion\n2 inches fresh ginger\n4 cups asparagus\n12 oz. mushrooms\n6 green onions\nThai basil (or regular)\n1 cauliflower\n2/3 lb. potatoes\n2/3 lb. turnips\n1 lemon\nParsley\n4 bananas\n4 sweet potatoes\nVeggies for 2 dinners\nSide salad veggies for 1 dinner\nFresh fruit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrains & Canned Goods\n1.5 dry cups quinoa\n4 oz. low sodium chicken broth\n2 cups oats\n1 cup brown rice\nLight English muffins\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\nLow sodium soy sauce\nAsian chili garlic paste (like sambal olek)\n1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth\nUnsweetened cocoa powder\n1/4 cup black olives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPantry\nCooking spray\nOlive oil\nCoconut oil\nBrown sugar\nBalsamic vinegar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpices\nSalt\nPepper\nGarlic powder\nOnion powder\nChili powder\nSmoked paprika\nOregano\nDried dill\nThyme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterested in more Slender Kitchen recipes?
