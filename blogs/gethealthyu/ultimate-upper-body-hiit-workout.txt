"When you think of HIIT (“High Intensity Interval Training”) you usually think about exercises like squat jumps, jump lunges and other standing moves. But here’s a newsflash: you can use HIIT to work your upper body, too! Upper body HIIT workouts help you strengthen and tone your way to beautiful arms and shoulders using the HIIT format for extra heart rate intensity and calorie burn. In upper body HIIT workouts, strength exercises such as push-ups and tricep dips are combined with upper body power moves such as push-up jacks or burpees. This combination helps you build muscle while burning calories, giving you a complete and awesome workout.\nThe Workout\nRemember, when it comes to HIIT, the key to your results is dependent on your effort. For each exercise you will go as hard as you can for 20 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds before going to the next move.
