"Bubble butts and booty trends may come and go, but one thing never goes out of style: a firm, lifted backside. That’s why we’ve put together this Bubble Butt Workout. But first, let’s talk about glutes.\n\n\n\nThe truth is, your gluteus maximus is the largest muscle in your body, so strengthening and firming your rear does more for you than just help you look hot in a pair of jeans.\n\n\n\nGlute strength can help reduce hip and knee pain and protect your back from injury; it also improves your athletic performance in nearly any workout.\n\n\n\nIn this article, we’ll explain how the glute muscles work, why strong glutes are important, and how to achieve that toned and lifted bubble butt with exercise, not over-the-top medical procedures.\n\n\n\n(Yep, butt enhancement surgeries are one of the most common plastic surgery procedures around…and totally unnecessary!)\n\n\n\nIn this article:\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a firm buttBenefits of glute strengthFull Bubble Butt WorkoutBasic SquatSkatersJump SquatResistance Band Butt BlasterGlute BridgesPlié SquatsCross Behind LungesFree PDF Download: Bubble Butt Workout \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscles To Work for a Firm Butt\n\n\n\nHow to get a bubble butt starts with understanding the mechanics of your powerful butt muscles.\n\n\n\nWhen you think of toning your butt, you may picture the actual butt cheek itself, but there are actually a few different muscles responsible for creating a firm, lifted appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three muscles that make up your rear:\n\n\n\nthe gluteus maximus: the largest muscle in you body, which produces the shape of the buttocks and helps with hip and thigh movement.the gluteus medius: a fan-shaped muscle that assists in hip rotation.the gluteus minimus: muscle that helps with thigh rotation.\n\n\n\nYour hamstrings also extend up towards your glute muscles, making them an important muscle to include in your next butt workout. \n\n\n\nHamstrings are a frequently overlooked muscle, but you need strong hamstrings to not only prevent injury to your hips but also create a lean, tight backside.\n\n\n\nWhy Glute Strength Is Important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll talk of bubble butts aside, glute strength is important for overall strength and fitness. As mentioned, your glutes are the largest muscle in your body, and they’re crucial for so many different movements concerning your hips and thighs.\n\n\n\nHere are three reasons you need to strengthen your glutes in order to get a round butt:\n\n\n\n1. Improves Your Posture\n\n\n\nMost of us sit for long periods of time for work and this causes the glute muscles to “turn off” so to speak.\n\n\n\nWhen our glutes aren’t firing effectively, our hip flexors tighten and shorten, which not only increases the chances for injuries to our hips and knees, but can cause what’s known as “postural deviations” such as slouching.\n\n\n\nStrong, activated glute muscles prevent this from happening and keep our postural alignment upright and healthy.\n\n\n\n2. Reduces hip/back/knee pain\n\n\n\nStrong glutes stabilize your pelvis and help protect your hips from injury. Similarly, when your hips are protected, your lower back is also free of pain.\n\n\n\nWhen your pelvis is stable, it also takes the pressure off your knees and ankles, which can overcompensate otherwise. All around, strong glutes lead to a pain-free body.\n\n\n\nRelated: Sciatica Stretches to Relieve Pain Fast \n\n\n\n3. Improves Athletic Performance\n\n\n\nStrong glutes are also key to athleticism: they boost your agility, speed, and overall athletic performance.\n\n\n\nEspecially if you’re a runner, strong glutes help propel you farther and faster, not to mention they reduce the impact your feet have to take every time they strike the ground. \n\n\n\nBubble butt exercises are more than aesthetic – they’re athletic!\n\n\n\nBubble Butt Workout: 7 Exercises To Get Round Glutes\n\n\n\nNow that you know the importance of working your glute muscles, let’s get into the exercises for a curvy, round butt.\n\n\n\nSquats are known for their ability to build beautiful backsides, but we’ve also added plyometric movements to this workout—plyometrics make a huge difference in building muscle quickly.\n\n\n\nYou can incorporate these movements into your existing workouts, or do them all together for one killer, butt-kicking workout!\n\n\n\nIf you do them all together, perform 8-10 repetitions of each exercise. These moves are all bodyweight except for the resistance band butt blaster—but this move can be modified without the resistance band, too.\n\n\n\nHere are seven of the best bubble butt exercises to turn a flat booty into a firm, round bubble butt:\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n1.
