"Peanut butter and jelly are amazing together. (Wine and chocolate isn’t a bad combo either…) So when it comes to workouts, tabata intervals and isometric holds are the powerful duo that will kick you in the butt and shrink it a little at the same time! By combining the heart-pumping quality of fast, tabata intervals with the power of holding an exercise in place while your muscles are shaking, you can maximize your time spent working out and minimize the amount of time you need to put in!\nIn this challenge you will want to warm up with a light jog for a minute and then go through five simple exercises all in the same way:\n1.  Power through the exercise as intensely as you can for 20 seconds.\n2.  Immediately go to the isometric hold indicated for 10 seconds.\n3.  Do 8 rounds total per exercise and then move to the next one.\nBoom! In 20 minutes you have burned more calories than a light jog for an hour. Now that’s what I call a bargain. Don’t forget to stretch when you are finished catching your breath.\nSquat Jump\n\nA) Start standing with feet hip distance apart and lower into a squat position by bending the knees.
