But if you struggle with push-ups or really would rather just skip them, this at-home dumbbell chest workout is a great option.\nDumbbell chest exercises are some of the most underrated moves in fitness. We turn to push-ups because they work and use barbells for the same reason.\nBut the truth is that dumbbells give you an equally good and completely unique chest and upper body workout with a lot more variety and some amazing benefits. You don’t need endless push-ups or a bulky bench press machine to get a solid at-home chest workout.\nUse the links below to quickly navigate this article:\n\nBenefits of Chest Exercises For Women\nWhat Kind of Dumbbells Should You Use?\nAdjustable vs. Fixed Dumbbells\nJump To Our Dumbbell Chest Workout\n\n\nBenefits of Chest Exercises for Women\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking on your chest muscles with dumbbells is part of a well-balanced strength program. The pushing and pulling actions used in a dumbbell chest workout are part and parcel to things you do in everyday life like lifting things onto high shelves overhead, pushing a sofa or chair so you can clean around it, or even lifting a car seat with a child.\nAdditionally, chest exercises for women help protect shoulder joints from injury during all of these activities as well as improve the balance of your whole body for better posture.\nSo why should you use those convenient at home dumbbells to strengthen the chest? Let’s look at some reasons chest exercises for women are essential to your strength routine.\n1. More Variety\nA barbell chest press is a pretty limited exercise. You pull the bar to your chest and press it up. It’s a fixed activity. Similarly, aside from moving your hand positions, push-ups do a fairly fixed movement.\nDumbbell chest exercises, on the other hand, give you a variety of ways to focus on all of your chest muscles. You can begin with a basic chest press and then by simply turning your palms inward change the focus of the muscles used.\nJust as quickly you can draw your arms close to your side and turn it into a tricep-focused chest press. Now switch to a dumbbell chest fly adding more dimension to the smaller chest muscles that might otherwise be ignored.\nDumbbells simply give more variety.\n2. Easier On The Joints\nPush-ups are THE go-to exercise for most people, and for good reason. They work! The problem is that many people are unable to do push-ups due to overuse and joint injuries, usually in the shoulder. When done improperly push-ups can lead to shoulder injuries very quickly.\nOn the other hand, pressing a barbell up and down has risks of its own. If one side of your body is weaker than the other (which is true for most people) your strong side will subtly but certainly kick-in as needed to bear the extra weight. This means you are at risk for problems with that side over time.\nHaving a dumbbell in each hand keeps both sides equally accountable. Plus, it means you have to work harder to stabilize the weights giving you not only a more balanced activity but one that also strengthens your core and all the smaller muscles that surround that target chest area.\n3. Bigger Range Of Motion\nFor those of you looking to strengthen the chest more quickly, dumbbells should be your choice. Using similar weight to a barbell bench press, the difference is that the barbell stops at the chest no matter what your flexibility is.\nDumbbells, however, allow you to go farther, especially if you have more shoulder flexibility. Just be careful to do them slowly and safely to protect yourself from over-stretching your muscles or injuring yourself.\nPro tip: Go slower on the way down. Lower the weights to a slow 4-count and then press them up.\n\nWhat Kind of Dumbbells Should You Use?\n\n\n\n\n\nSo maybe you are convinced to give an at-home dumbbell chest workout a try. If so, you probably think that once you decide between 10-, 12- or 15-pound dumbbells you’re set to make a purchase.\nWhat you might not know is that when you search online or show up at the store there are plenty of other things to consider including options that are above and beyond how heavy your weight will be.\nThe texture, the functionality, the circumference, the shape…. Buckle up and get ready to think through these choices and what might be best for you.\n\nAdjustable vs. Fixed Dumbbells\nFirst, you have to decide whether you want several different pair of dumbbells or just one pair that can be more versatile. There are traditional dumbbells that you are used to seeing in a gym or in a fitness video, then there are adjustable dumbbells that are made to change up the same set of weights as needed for use.\nSo what is best for you? Here are some things to consider:\nAdjustable weights\nAdjustable dumbbells and weights are versatile and take up less space in your home because you are virtually using just one pair of dumbbells for everything. With interchangeable weights, you simply click a lever or pull a pin, and your dumbbell changes from 10 pounds to 15 just like that.\nThink of a barbell and how you add plates on and off the end in order to adjust. This is the same concept only in a smaller form! Cool, right? Of course, it will cost you.\nWhen you go to purchase adjustable weights there are several manufacturers to choose from. Do some pre-shopping online to check them out.\nA couple of the main brands include Powerblock which ranges from $150-$350 per pair as well as Bowflex which offers basic weights, high tech “Bluetooth” weights and more ranging from $329-$529.\nBoth of these brands adjustable dumbbells range from 5 lb.’s all the up to 90 pounds. Yup! You heard it! One pair and you can pretty much do it all!\nFixed dumbbells\nFixed weights on the other hand, are the more traditional option and a staple in the trainer’s collection of goodies. If you don’t mind having several pair taking up space, these regular dumbbells are a cheaper option and allow you to purchase only what you need as you need it.\nIn addition, you can lay out several options at the beginning of a workout and more quickly switch between weight levels during your dumbbell chest workout than you are able to with adjustable dumbbells.\nAs you start your collection you may start out with a set of 5 lb. and 8 lb. weights and in a few months you purchase another 10 lb. pair.\nMost of the traditional dumbbells, including the most popular brand  SPRI , cost anywhere from $9-15 per pair.\nIf you do go with the traditional dumbbell there are even more options for you to choose from. Do you want soft, coated weights or metal and rubber? Round-shaped ends or hexagon?\nRubber coated weights are nice for the grip, especially as your hands get sweaty. They are softer to the touch and your hands are less likely to slip when wet. In addition, the softness makes it better for things you do in a plank position such as renegade rows where the metal center can be irritating or even painful to your palms.\nOn the other hand, rubber-coated weights usually have round ends making them move around more in a plank position.\nTraditional hexagon metal and rubber weights may be easier for some to grip in the center because although they are a harder surface they are a small circumference making it easier for small hands to hold and better for those who might have arthritis.\nIt’s based purely on personal preference so try them both before you decide.\nAt Home Dumbbell Chest Workout for Women\nWe put together this program of chest exercises for women who want something focused yet easy to add to their workout routine.\nThis dumbbell chest workout consists of a short warm-up followed by three rounds of exercises.
