"Are you ready to get fabulous arms? Walk through the free weight area in any gym, and my guess is the most common exercise you will see is the infamous bicep curl! It’s just too easy to pass up. You grab a set of dumbbells and curl them up and down while your eyes dart around the room in boredom hoping to see something a bit more creative you could do. Biceps are easily the most overtrained muscle on our body, and yet when it comes to getting fabulous arms, there is so much more in store for you beyond the traditional curl!\nYou see bicep curls work….umm… the biceps. That’s great, but your arms are so much more! When you truly want to make changes in your arms, you want to work as many muscles as you can in as few exercises as possible.

Of course, as you get stronger, make sure you increase the weight enough so that you are struggling to finish your final rep. Perform each exercise for the specific reps listed. Rest at the end, and then repeat.\nArmy Crawl\n\n\n\n\n\nA)  Begin in a plank position with your shoulders over your wrists, your feet together, and your body in a straight line.\nB)  Bend your left arm so that it is now in forearm plank position.
