"You already know that yoga is a natural detoxifier, yoga can help alleviate back pain, and yoga will help you sleep better. But did you also know yoga can land you a strong core and better abs? It’s true. If you’re engaging your abs, you can strengthen your core through pretty much any yoga pose. But certain yoga poses are particularly good at working the abs, and those are the ones we’ve included in the following 6-minute yoga flow for better abs. Whether you’re a yoga beginner or a regular Vinyasa mama, this quick workout is perfect to squeeze in when you want better abs. Before we get to the 6-minute yoga flow, though, we also want to give you some practical lifestyle tips to score a sculpted stomach even when you’re off the mat.\n\nHow To Get Better Abs: The Basics\nLet’s be honest: if getting a toned stomach were easy, everyone would have one. It’s really not as simple as doing one specific exercise (ahem, crunches) or eating one specific food. So before we get to our 6-minute yoga flow, here are some tips on overall lifestyle changes to make if you want better abs:\nGet Your Cardio In\nIn addition to keeping your heart healthy, cardio burns mega calories and will help you shed any extra fat covering up those abs. The CDC recommends 150 minutes of cardio per week, and you can break that up however you like. Choose to do two hour long workouts and one half hour workout, or perform a half hour workout five days a week. Here are some different forms of cardio that can count towards your weekly 150 minutes:\n\nBiking\nWalking/hiking at a brisk pace\nRunning\nSpin class\nSwimming\nKickboxing\nDance\nBodyweight workouts\n\nStrength Train\nAside from heart-pumping cardio to burn fat, you also need to build muscle to rev your metabolism. The more muscle you have on your body, the more calories you can burn at rest. (Score!) Plus, you obviously need strength training to sculpt your muscles and get a toned appearance. Once you shed weight from your body, if you want to tone the muscles underneath you’ll need to strength train. You can use weights or your own bodyweight, but try to do two strength training workouts per week. Pressed for time?

Eliminating processed foods, added sugars, and calorie-laden beverages like soda should be your first step. Next, replace pre-packaged foods and high-calorie dishes with healthy grains like quinoa, lean protein like salmon or chicken, and plenty of vegetables. Add in fruit, healthy fats like avocado, and you’ll be on the path to a cleaner diet and slimmer waist. Want a comprehensive guide on what clean eating really means?
