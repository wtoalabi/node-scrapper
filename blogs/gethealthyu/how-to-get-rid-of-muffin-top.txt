The most obvious cause of a muffin top is simply carrying extra fat all over. But here are four other factors that can contribute to belly fat, too.\n\nGenetics: If you’re carrying a little extra fat all over, some of it will logically be carried around your waistline. But the truth is, where your body naturally tends to store the most fat is mostly due to genetics. But don’t use your genetics as an excuse to feel defeated. If you have excess belly fat, you can start by losing fat all over and then toning your abs.\nPoor diet: Consuming a lot of sugary sodas, salty foods, and artificial ingredients will naturally trigger belly bloating in different people. To debloat fast try keeping a food log for a week to write down what you ate for each meal and how your stomach feels afterwards.\nStress: Not only does chronic stress contribute to storing excess visceral fat (fat stored within your abdominal cavity), but being stressed can naturally make you reach for more salty and sugary snacks as a coping mechanism and leading to those love handles.\nHormones: If you’re entering perimenopause or menopause and finding you have more fat around your middle, it could be a change in hormones. If you are estrogen dominant, you can store more belly fat than you want.

Clean Up Your Diet\nThe best muffin top workout isn’t a workout at all – it’s all about the food. You’ve probably heard this phrase by now, but if you haven’t, listen loud and clear: You can’t work off a bad diet. In an editorial by the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers say excess sugar and processed carbs— not physical inactivity— are primarily to blame for the growing obesity epidemic.\nExcess calories, especially those in the form of sugar and unhealthy fats, end up as fat on your body and that includes your belly. The goal is to expend more calories than you take in to lose weight. One way you can do this is by eating clean. \nEating clean doesn’t mean you have to get rid of all the things you love! The key is to choose primarily whole foods, and eat small meals regularly. The best foods to get rid of muffin top fat are whole foods. This means fiber-filled vegetables, fruit, lean protein and healthy fats. Walk the perimeter of your local grocer or visit a farmers market just to see your options.\nAnd for some inspiration, try these high-protein, low-calorie breakfasts that kickstart your metabolism and prevent overeating later in the day.\n2. HIIT Exercises\nIf there’s any muffin top exercise that will help you lose a muffin top fast, it’s HIIT. High Intensity Interval Training is a form of cardio that has you work as hard as you can for short periods of time (20-30 seconds) with short periods of rest in between.\nHIIT training, or similar styles like Tabata intervals, are more efficient at burning calories and keep your metabolism elevated long after you are done exercising. So calories will continue to burn even as you move throughout the next part of your day.\nThe American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week. This includes a mixture of cardio, High Intensity Interval Training, and strength training.\n3. Get Enough Sleep\nYou may not immediately connect the dots between sleep and your weight, but research can prove it: study participants who were put on a sleep-deprived diet experienced a 55% reduction in fat loss compared to their well-rested counterparts.\nA lack of sleep can change your fat cells by disrupting your body’s ability to properly use insulin. Excess insulin can cause your body to store fat in unwanted places, like your waist, which can cause weight gain, belly fat, and even diabetes.\nAdults should regularly get the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep to stay healthy,  regulate their mood, and help them meet their weight loss goals. Tip – get rid of the phone in bed habit, it will drastically improve your sleep.\n4. Strengthen Your Core the Right Way\nEliminating belly fat around your midsection with better eating and proper exercise is crucial. For more targeted exercises to get rid of muffin top fat, the next step is to work on strengthening your Transverse Abdominus (“TVA”). This is the muscle that sits deep and low in your belly.\nBy taking time to strengthen this muscle properly, you create a built-in corset that will pull your tummy in, protect your low back and promote better posture—something that will also make you look leaner. Exercise methods such as Pilates are excellent for learning how to make this muscle rock solid. With a strong core, you’ll get rid of your muffin top and be equipped to prevent injuries long-term. \n8 Exercises to Get Rid of a Muffin Top\nNow that you know the proper steps to lose those love handles, try this muffin top workout in your home or at the gym to start targeting belly fat. \nThis HIIT-style muffin top workout for beginners combines high intensity cardio training with real core exercises to get rid of body fat, tone and tighten your tummy, and burn calories.\nInstructions for a 16-minute muffin top workout: \n\nDo each move for 20 seconds. 10 seconds rest in between.\nRepeat each exercise three times for a 16-minute workout!\n\n1.
