"We thought it would be fun to showcases some beef-free burger options that are a little outside the bun so to speak. We aren’t bashing beef, but since so many people are electing to eat a healthier diet, why not share our favorites from the Get Healthy U kitchen and around the web! These eight beef-free burgers are unique, tasty, and cover a wide spectrum of flavors your taste buds will cheer for. From salmon, turkey, meatless, to Moroccan, every party goer will be wowed by these healthier selections. My personal favorite is my Spicy Black Bean Burger! This low-cal, protein packed flavor sensation has a great texture that even your pickiest “meat lover” guest will love. Just mix up a batch of our low-cal Sassy Skinny Margaritas or Watermelon Mojitos and your BBQ will be a hit!\nMeatless Spicy Black Bean Burger\nA vegetarian option with a little kick! Who knew going meatless could be so tasty? I use a little pepper jack cheese in these burgers because it adds a nice hearty texture you can sick your teeth into. These burgers freeze really well and make a easy meal served with whole grain chips and my simple Homemade Hummus Recipe.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nDill Salmon Burger\nI love fresh salmon. It’s so tasty and packed with healthy fats like omega-3s that are crucial to good heart health. This light and delicious salmon burger is the perfect protein on a hot summer night with a side of creamy Potato Salad!\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: SlenderKitchen.com\nRelated: 10 Healthy Homemade Pizza Recipes\nGoat Cheese Stuffed Turkey Burger\nYou have heard of a Juicy Lucy, this healthier version takes the cake!

They are great served up on a toasted bun like this one, or they are also super tasty on top of a salad. Using a food processor makes this recipe a snap. I highly recommend trying this chipotle aioli that we put on burgers, sweet potato fries, fresh veggies, and just about anything we can find.\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: GetHealthyU.com\nTurkey Burger Pitas with Avocado & Feta\nDrop that bun and reach for a pita!
