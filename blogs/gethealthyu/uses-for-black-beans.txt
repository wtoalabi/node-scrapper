"If you’re looking to include additional sources of protein and fiber in your diet (which we all should be!), black beans are one of the best foods you can eat. Per 1 cup serving, black beans provide 15 grams of protein and 15 grams of fiber. And not only that but they also contain copper, iron, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, manganese, and zinc all of which help maintain strong bones, lower blood cholesterol, aid in digestion, ward off disease (including reducing your risk of cancer!) and help with weight loss. Plus, they’re super inexpensive making them one of the few foods that falls into what we like to call the “golden tri-fecta” meaning they are healthy, inexpensive and they taste good. So whether you buy a can of black beans every time you go to store or purchase them in bulk from Costco, here are 8 awesome uses for the can of black beans in your pantry.\nNachos\nNachos may be an obvious place to toss on some black beans and for good reason!
