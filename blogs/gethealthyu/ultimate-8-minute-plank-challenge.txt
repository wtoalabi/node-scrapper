"What’s so great about planks? I mean, seriously, they’re everywhere! You can’t hide from them! Can they really be that good?  Well, the answer is YES! This is not some fad that will change when the next great move comes along. The plank is one of those solid, tried-and-true moves that delivers on what it promises – tight, strong abs – as long as you do it right.\nWHAT MAKES A PLANK WORK?\nThe plank is what is known as a stability exercise. While there are a variety of creative planks that get you to move, the basic plank is an ‘isometric” hold- meaning you have tension in the muscle without contraction or movement. While you hold you position, gravity is trying to pull your mid-section down. You are engaging your core muscles to keep your back straight. Essentially you pull the muscle in so tightly that the strength comes in the stillness. The struggle for many people is that exercise = movement, so holding still doesn’t always resonate as effective. But that couldn’t be more wrong. Isometrics work and they work well! Try sitting in a chair pose for 1 minute and see if your legs feel the burn.\nWHAT MUSCLES DOES THE PLANK WORK?\nThe plank is one of the best exercises for a flat, toned stomach because it works all the muscles in your core including the rectus abdominus (the “six-pack”), transverse abdominus, internal and external obliques, hips and back. It also strengthens your shoulders, arms and upper back! Talk about a full body workout!\nBENEFITS OF PLANK\nFlatter Abs\nA.K.A. tighter tummy. Okay, maybe it’s vanity but I bet most of you would like flatter abs. But here’s the thing- it’s NOT just about good looks! Having a smaller tummy means less weight pulling in the front and straining on your back. A flatter tummy also promotes better posture and of course makes it easier to button your jeans.\nDecreased Back Pain\nThe strength built in your core during a plank is one of the best ways to ward off or help decrease back pain. Having a stronger core without putting strain on your spine makes for a healthy, happy back! The American Council on Exercise (“ACE”) includes the plank as one of the 5 best exercises to ward off back pain.\nImproved Balance and Posture\nAs noted before, having a nice, strong center is going to give you better posture. Practicing a plank will makes you stand taller and look leaner. In addition, your core is the center point for your balance. When you have better core strength you have better balance and balance is an absolute necessity, especially as we age!\nTHE 8-MINUTE PLANK CHALLENGE\nIf you’ve nailed the basic plank and are ready to step it up to the next level, then this challenge is for you!
