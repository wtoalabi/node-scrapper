"Planks are the rockstar of abdominal work.  There are so many reasons the plank is the holy grail of core exercises. First it’s not just for your abs. The plank also conditions and strengthens the lower back which is essential to prevent back pain.\nIs the plank more effective than the crunch?\nDon’t count the crunch out of your core workout routine, however, the plank does have an edge over the crunch. A plank provides superior results in terms of abdominal muscle activation and it also helps to optimize functional performance. If you have to choose one ab exercise, the plank offers more efficient and effective training for your core.\n\nDo planks help flatten your stomach?\nThe plank works the very important transverse abdominal muscles as well as the rectus abdominal muscles.\nThe transverse abdominal muscles are what pull your stomach in for that desired “flat” abs look. Like a corset, the transverse abdominals cinch in your waist and keep a stable core.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlank Variations\nBut now it’s time to open your eyes to all the different variations the plank has to offer!
