"Sun Salutations are to yoga what push-ups are to strength training. Every time you practice, there they are! Have you ever wondered why? Sun salutations have amazing benefits to make you stronger, burn calories, and stretch nearly every muscle in your body. So let’s look at the who, what, why, and how of the sun salutation.\nWho?\nYou, that’s who! Sun salutations are practiced by the true yogis who are on their mat every day, as well as the novice who steps into yoga for the first time. They can be tailored or modified as needed and you choose the pace at which you want to move. They are good for everyone.\nWhat?\nWhat is a sun salutation? Sun salutations are simply a series of poses in which you move fluidly with your breath. In other words, you inhale into one pose then exhale to the next. In that sense, it allows you to move at a moderate pace so you can enjoy the stretch, but fluidly enough to keep you in a rhythmic motion.\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\nSun salutations provide multiple benefits!\n\nYou achieve strength, particularly in your upper body and core, as you move through the planks and chaturangas.\nYou burn calories during the continuous, fluid movement, going as vigorously as you desire.\nYou stretch. The poses are designed so that you stretch and lengthen your muscles and connective tissue throughout the entire body\n\nWhere?\nCreate a nice space. Outside in the fresh air is the best, but most people practice indoors due to logistics.You will want a yoga mat or a flat, non-slippery surface to move on. Carpeted floors will frustrate you as your hands and feet slide out of poses. You don’t need much space at all, just enough for the length of your body! If the surface you practice on is hard and you want to put your knees down during the planks, just have a towel or sweatshirt available.\nRelated: How To Clean Your Yoga Mat\nWhen?\nSun salutations originated as a morning practice to line up with the rising of the sun. Morning is still the best time to practice a sun salutation because it is an excellent way to open the body and create energy for a new day. Plus, your digestive system is clear from any “interruptions.” However, sun salutations are great any time! Really! They can be used as a “stand alone” workout, as a preparation at the beginning of a yoga practice, or even as a post-workout stretch. It all depends on how you choose to practice.\n\n\n\n\nHow?\nOn to the part you were waiting for. Below is a traditional sun salutation series. There are pictures and descriptions to guide you through. Perform 2, 3, or 20 times! Just remember to listen to your body and honor the place you are in today.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: 6-Minute Yoga For Better Abs\n1.
