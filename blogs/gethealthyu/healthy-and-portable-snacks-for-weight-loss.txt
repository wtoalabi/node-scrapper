"Whether you’re trying to slim down, maintain weight or simply stay energized to power through a workout or workday, having healthy and portable snacks handy is important. Some may think that by skipping meals, you’re better able to lose weight but in fact, the opposite is true.

That’s why we’ve put together this list of 17 healthy and portable snacks to meet whatever health goals you have in mind..\nThese 17 healthy and easy snacks will curb your hunger, satiate your tastebuds, nourish your body and provide you with the valuable fuel you need to get through the day no matter your tasks.\n\nRoasted Chickpeas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it’s the crunch you crave, potato chips can seem like the go-to, but with 9 grams of protein in 3/4 of a cup, roasted chickpeas are the better option.
