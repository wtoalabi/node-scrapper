"Sometimes the hardest part of committing to a great workout is all the prep-work involved. You have to make sure you’re wearing the right shoes for the right exercise; you spend time picking out the right weight for your dumbbell or the resistance band that’s tight enough but not going kill your shoulders. By the time you get to the actual exercise part, you’re ready to throw in the towel and go get a pizza. So how about skipping all of that hassle and just taking six quick minutes at home (or anywhere else) to get your workout done? No-equipment workouts are not only on-trend but super easy and effective. This six-minute no-equipment workout is a no-frills way to get in shape using the challenge of just your own body.\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits Of Bodyweight-Only Workouts\nUsing dumbbells or machines to strength train or get your cardio on are great, don’t get us wrong. But it’s important to remember that all you really need to get an effective workout is your own body. Here are just a few amazing benefits of bodyweight-only, no-equipment workouts:\n1. Combines Strength + Cardio\nBodyweight workouts allow you to easily combine strength and cardio, which is the fat-burning equation you need to truly transform your body. If you want to lose weight and gain muscle, you can’t just do strength OR cardio, you need them both! Bodyweight workouts where you transition from strength training moves to cardio intervals work both your aerobic and anaerobic systems, giving you the cardiovascular and muscle benefits you need to get in shape!\n2. They’re Easy to Modify To Fit Your Fitness Level\n\n\n\n\n\nWith weighted workouts, you really have to make sure you’ve found the correct weight for different exercises, otherwise the move will either be too easy or too challenging and possibly risky. But with bodyweight exercises, it’s more intuitive. You start doing the movement, and if it’s not challenging enough you can do more repetitions or increase your speed; similarly, if it’s too challenging you can go slower or take breaks in between.\n3. You Can Do Them Anywhere + They Cost NOTHING!\nGyms and group fitness classes are great, but with bodyweight-only workouts you can get a solid workout done anywhere, at any time. All you need is a little space and your own body! It’s freeing to know that you don’t have to drive to the gym, park, go to the locker room, wait for a machine to open up, etc. With no-equipment workouts, it’s all in your hands. You can workout at home, while traveling, or wherever else you might be.\n6-Minute No-Equipment Workout\nAlright, now that we’ve covered why bodyweight exercise rocks, let’s get down to a quick bodyweight workout you can try yourself.
