The front knee is a 90-degree angle and the back heel lifted. Arms are in guard position in front of the chest.\nB) Drive the back knee up to hip height towards the hands, and hands in towards the thigh. Return the foot to floor and repeat.\nPerform on right leg for one minute, then left leg one minute with no break in between.\n \nMountain Climbers\nA) Place hands on floor slightly wider than shoulder distance apart. Bring your body into plank position and engage your abdominals.\nB) Bring one knee in towards your chest then switch feet and draw the other knee in alternating back and forth quickly. To keep it low-impact, do not pull the opposite knee in until the first foot is touching down. In other words, drive the knees quickly but do not “run.”\nGo for 1 minute.\nNote: If this exercise bothers your back or knees, try it standing up!\n \nPunching\n\nA) Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder distance apart and bend knees slightly. Tighten the core to keep your center still.\nB) Punch out one arm at a time at a steady but fast pace. For more intensity, sit deeper as you punch. Punch hard and punch fast!\nPerform for one minute building intensity and speed throughout.\nSkaters\n\nA) Start with your legs slightly wider than shoulder distance apart and arms at the sides.\nB) Bring one leg behind at a slight angle into a reverse lunge. The front knee will come to a 90-degree angle.\nC) Swing the arms in front of that bent knee and leap the back leg forward to switch sides in a skating motion. Arms alternate as you switch sides like a speed skater.  To keep low impact, do not come off the ground as you switch feet.\nPerform for one minute, building intensity throughout.\nWant more?
