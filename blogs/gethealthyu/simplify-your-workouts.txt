"Simplify Your Workouts! It’s not complicated! This has been my mantra when it comes to getting people eating well and moving: “It’s not complicated.” It calls for commitment and sometimes hard work. But complicated? No, it doesn’t have to be! Just eat a little healthier; move a little more; and you will improve performance. The problem is, it’s easy to make things more difficult and elaborate than they need to be. Perhaps you remember the early days of step classes. When I first started teaching step, there were five basic choreography moves everyone was doing.\nThen step patterns got really crazy! People were going “over the top” and “boomeranging” over their steps. I sometimes practiced for hours just to teach one really elaborate choreographed class – that’s how complicated it was. Then people realized something: They didn’t want—or couldn’t do—all that complex stuff. Now step classes are back to basics again!\n4 Easy Ways To Simplify Your Workouts\n1. Start With Bodyweight\nBodyweight moves are some of the most effective around. They’re great for getting your heart pumping and strengthening your body, and they require zero equipment. Squats and lunges are some of the most effective moves around for toning your lower half and conditioning your body. But go to any gym, and you’ll see people doing really complicated variations on these two otherwise simple moves. Why? Well, advanced exercisers might need and want some squat or  lunge variations; and that’s ok too!\n2. Keep It Simple\nIf you’re struggling just to do an exercise the right way without all the “fancy,” then simpler is better. And if the basic feels too complicated, make it even more basic! The most important thing for any move is to do it correctly, using the proper alignment and the full range of motion. Don’t aim for a million reps at first, just get down the basics and you’ll build a foundation for many more reps to come!\n3. Modify\nI always say there’s no shame in modifying, only quitting. And, honestly, quitting is complicated because now you have to add “get in shape” back on your to-do list! When you modify exercise so it feels manageable, you cut the “complicated” out of the exercise equation. If you can’t quite do a regular push-up yet, try a modified push-up on your knees! It’s better to start small than not start at all.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIt's better to start small than not start at all.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tClick to Tweet\n\t\t\n4. Remember That Form Trumps Everything\nLearn great lunging form first. Basic technique trumps everything else because it lays the foundation for working your way up from there. Oh, and it saves your knees, back, hips, and prevents injury.\nStep back and take a look at the workouts you’re doing now. If they feel like a burden and not a welcome part of your day, perhaps re-evaluate how you could make them less complicated.\nREAD THIS NEXT: 6 Great Sites for Healthy Living"
