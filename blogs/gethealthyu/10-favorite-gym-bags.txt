Your gym bag probably contains your workout clothes, those cross trainer shoes, your water bottle, a gym log or food journal, cool tunes (and something to play them on), a fitness timer and a towel for sweaty you post-workout. Am I close? All of those cool fitness tools tossed into your gym bag help you work on that healthy body of yours, so don’t you want to give them a fashionable home? Here are 10 of my absolute favorite gym bags. Warning, these bags are so fun they are known to cause spontaneous trips to the gym.
