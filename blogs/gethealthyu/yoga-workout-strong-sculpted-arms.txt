"Tired of the same old dumbbell routine in an attempt to make your arms stronger and more sculpted? Welcome to yoga! Well-known for its stretching and flexibility benefits, yoga is also a kick-butt way to strengthen every muscle in your upper body. With a majority of your time spent down on the floor pushing your bodyweight around, this no-nonsense, all business yoga routine might make you shake a little in the process, but it will definitely leave you with strong, sculpted arms.\nOften in an attempt to shape our arms, we go right to dumbbells or hand weights because we associate them with strength. The reality is that your own bodyweight is likely much more powerful than the 5 or 10 pound hand weights that you pick up at the gym. The bodyweight training you do in yoga not only provides a well-needed challenge, but is a functional way to move with all the added benefits of yoga to boot! Practice this routine 2-3 times per week and you’ll have a beautiful upper body in no time.\nVinyasa Flow\nTo begin the workout, practice the vinyasa flow shown here. Vinyasa flow is a series of 4 exercises done in succession—a flow—that wakes up the muscles and get the blood flowing to the places you most want it. Try doing this vinyasa flow between 6 to 8 times before going on to the poses that you will hold.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Plank\nA) Begin on your hands and knees. Pull your abdominals in and step your feet back behind you until your legs are straight.\nB) Keep hands directly under shoulders and eyes at the front of your mat so your neck remains aligned.\nC) Hold the abdominals and legs tight and make sure your back stays long; avoid sagging in the low back.\n2. Chaturanga\nA) Coming out of the plank position, slowly lower your chest toward the ground pulling elbows towards your ribs and looking toward the floor in front of you.\nB) Keep your hips just slightly above your chest and squeeze your abs.\n3. Up Dog\nA) Coming out of the chatarunga, gently flip your feet so that the tops of your feet are now on the mat and your toes are pointed.\nB) As you exhale, press through your hands and the tops of your feet raising your body and legs up off the ground until arms are straight.\n4. Downward Dog\nA) Coming out of the up dog position, tuck your toes under and engage your abdominals as you push your body up off the mat so only your hands and feet are on the mat.\nB) Press through your hands moving your chest gently toward your thighs and your heels gently toward the floor.\nC) Move shoulders forward over wrist so you are back in plank position and begin to flow again.\nRelated: Wake-Me-Up Morning Yoga Workout\nAfter 6-8 times through the vinyasa flow, move right into these poses, which you will hold for 30 seconds or more to build strength.
