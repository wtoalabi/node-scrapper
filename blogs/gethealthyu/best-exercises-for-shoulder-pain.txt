"Shoulder pain can be both irritating and very disruptive to your every-day life. If you have ever injured or hurt your shoulder you know what I’m talking about. Lifting grocery bags, carrying a purse or even just trying to open a door can be impossible. In addition, some shoulder pain can be severe enough to interrupt your sleep or force you to miss work. According to the Mayo Clinic, shoulder pain may arise from the shoulder joint itself or from any of the many surrounding muscles, ligaments or tendons. Shoulder pain that comes from the joint usually worsens with activities or movement of your arm or shoulder.\nThe Shoulder\nThe shoulder is a ball and socket joint that connects your arm to your body. The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that help stabilize the shoulder. Any time you move your shoulder you are using your rotator cuff. The shoulder is remarkable in its movement pattern because this ball and socket joint can move in more directions than other places on your body. For instance, your knee can flex and bend forward and back, while the shoulder can make circular motions and reach in cross patterns. On the other hand, this is also what makes the shoulder vulnerable to injury. Due to all of the soft-tissue in the shoulder, you are more likely to do damage or suffer injuries from repetitive poor movement patters. Tendonitis, strains, tears, bursitis – these are all common issues that arise in shoulders.\nRelated: 7 Moves To Sculpt Your Back and Shoulders\nCommon Shoulder Injuries\nLet’s take a look at these common shoulder injuries, the accompanying symptoms, and what the usual course of treatment is. Following these descriptions you’ll find some recommended exercises used in shoulder rehab to help regain your range of motion and build back strength once your shoulder is healed.\nTendonitis\nShoulder tendonitis is an inflammation injury to the shoulder. Tendonitis comes from repeated micro-trauma to the rotator cuff rather than from one specific injury.\nSymptoms: \n\nPain if you lift your arm straight or lay on your shoulder\nShoulder pain when arm is at shoulder height\nA “clicking” sound during the movement of the shoulder\n\nTreatment:\n\nAt first symptoms, rest, ice and take anti-inflammatories\nAfter the initial resting, you’ll want to regain your range of motion with physical therapy or specific exercises. (See below)\n\nBursitis\nA bursa is a tiny fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding disc to reduce friction between tissues on the body. Bursitis is inflammation of the shoulder bursa, which generally occurs from either injury or strain to the shoulder. If you lift things overhead or make repetitive movements like throwing a baseball over and over, you might be a candidate for bursitis.\nSymptoms: The symptoms of shoulder bursitis are similar to shoulder tendonitis. In fact, these two injuries often occur at the same time.\n\nLocalized pain, swelling or tenderness- usually the outside of the shoulder\nPain that gradually increases over weeks\nPain with motion of the affected area\nPain when you lay on the affected area\n\nTreatment:\n\nAt first symptoms, rest, ice and take anti-inflammatories\nSpecific exercises and/or physical therapy\nReleasing fluid from the bursa and/or injecting the area with Cortisone may be something a doctor suggests if symptoms persist\n\nSprain/Strain\nA sprained ankle probably seems more common to most people, but you can strain or sprain your shoulder just as easily. In this injury, the ligaments that support and stabilize the shoulder are stretched or torn. These injuries can be minimal (grade 1) to very serious (grade 6) or anywhere in between. Most people experience minor strains – grade 1 or 2. Sprains come from an injury or accident whereas strains come from overuse or repetitive movement such as carrying a heavy purse or bag over the same shoulder or performing a large number of push-ups incorrectly.\nSymptoms: The symptoms of shoulder sprains and strains are similar:\nSprains:\n\nFeeling a “pop” in the area followed by swelling and bruising\nStiffness or instability near the affected area\nWarmth or redness of the affected area\n\nStrains\n\nMuscle spasm, swelling or cramping\nSharp pain at the site of the injury\n\nTreatment:\n\nAt first symptoms rest, ice and take anti-inflammatories\nImmobilize the shoulder with a sling or wrap\nTherapists may use ultra sound or other therapies to reduce swelling and inflammation as well as suggest exercises once the healing has taken place.\n\nExercises For Shoulder Pain\nEarly detection is the key to preventing serious shoulder injuries. Phase 1 of treatment almost always involves RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. Sometimes using a sling or wrap to keep your shoulder immobilized helps move the healing process along. Once the initial days or weeks help pain subside and swelling go down, you can move on to some shoulder exercises that might help you get your range of motion back and help the full healing process take place.\nPLEASE NOTE: These exercises are not prescriptions specifically designed for you. Please see your doctor or physical therapist and find your specific injury and prescription for healing. The following exercises are a small sample of many that are available and your doctor or therapist will know which ones are right for you.\nPendulum Swing\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipment: None\nRepetitions: 2 sets of 10; 5-6 days a week\nPrepare your shoulder and warm it up with this move.
