"If you’re on the hunt for the best exercises for diastasis recti, you’re probably someone who’s been pregnant. You’ve likely been researching the condition known as Diastasis Recti. According to the Mayo Clinic, Diastasis Recti is a condition in which “the two large parallel bands of muscles that meet in the middle of the abdomen begin to separate.”\nThink of splitting your six-pack into two three-packs. Diastasis Recti might cause a bulge in the middle where the two muscles separate.\nSince all of the abdominal muscles meet at the front of your abdomen, when the connective tissue in the middle is weakened and stretches far enough to leave a gap, it takes all of your ab muscles with it.\nYou probably know your core is the center of the strength in your body. So if your core muscles are all compromised, the rest of your body is too.\nIt’s a complex subject, and no true steadfast rules exist since many of us ladies may have varying degrees of the condition.\nBut there are tips on how to workout with Diastasis Recti; getting back into an exercise routine with the condition can be done.\nRelated: Postpartum Pilates Core Workout\nWhat Is Diastasis Recti Anyway?\n\n\n\n\n\nDiastasis most often develops in the late stages of pregnancy and appears postpartum. But the truth is that not only pregnant women can get diastasis.\nAny time your transverse abdominus (low abs) are not strong enough to support what you are doing, this split can occur.\nFirst and foremost, it should be said that if you think you have this condition, you should see your doctor. It may be serious, or it may be nothing at all.\nIn fact, a small widening of the midline is totally normal in pregnancy and not cause for alarm. But two-thirds of all pregnancies will result in diastasis, so it is something all pregnant women—and really everyone—should educate themselves on.\nDiastasis can happen to anyone.\nHow Do I Know If I Have It?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may see a “pooching” or a protrusion of your stomach, especially when coming up from a lying position on your back.\nSometimes you feel like you appear still a few months pregnant, which can be bothersome.\nTo Test For Diastasis Recti:\n\nLie on back with knees bent, feet flat on floor.\nPlace fingers just above belly button.\nLift head & neck slightly off floor, press down with fingertips. You’ll feel the muscles close around fingers as you lift head and neck.*\nRepeat test directly over belly button and a few inches below.\n\n*If you feel a gap, that’s diastasis.\nA diastasis recti gap is measured in finger widths. You are aiming for a 1-2 finger gap or less, but don’t panic if it’s much bigger at first.\nEven more important than the width of the gap though, is the tension (or lack of tension) in the midline: the linea alba.\nContracting the muscles should create tension and resistance to your application of gentle pressure with your fingers to the midline.\nIf it doesn’t, we need to get to work!\nThe Best Exercises for Diastasis Recti\nWell, it may never completely go away (I still have about a two-finger width when I lie down), in many cases you can reduce the problem through exercise by strengthening your core. We’re laying out the best exercises for diastasis recti below.\nIn order to gain back strength and tightness, you have to work your entire core, starting with—and mostly focusing on—the transverse abdominus (a.k.a. “TVA”).\nIf you have a severe case, it can’t be done through regular ab exercises—they will only make things worse!\nThe best exercises you can do will not feel like exercises at all! They are stabilization exercises and once you learn them, you will never let them go.\nPractice these first and we can address more workouts once you have these down pat!\nPilates Breathing\n\nLay on your back with your hands on your low abs\nRelax your ab muscles as you inhale air into your deep belly\nAs you exhale, imagine there is a small coffee stir-stick in your mouth and you are blowing air through it. Gently but firmly push the air out that small hole.\nYou should feel the muscle under your hands engaging as you exhale.\nTry 8-10 good breaths.\n\nSide Lying Imprint/Release\n\nStart by lying on your side and placing your fingers to feel your abdominal wall just inside your pelvic bone\nUsing the breath from Step 1, as you exhale, pull your low belly toward your spine.\nHold this muscle in as you take two breaths, then release.\nTry 6-8 times.\n\nImprint/Release\n\nStart by lying on your back and placing your hands on your low belly.\nBreathe the same way as in step 1, but as you exhale pull your low belly into your spine and gently press your low back onto the floor.\nAs you inhale release.\nTry 8-10 times.\n\nHeel Slides\n\nStart by lying on your back, knees bent, feet on the floor and placing hands on your low belly. Inhale.\nAs you exhale, draw your low abdominals inward toward your spine\nHold this stabilization and inhale to let your right knee gently “fall” to the right without your hips tilting\nExhale as you slide your right leg forward to straighten and pull back up to kneeling start position.\nTry 4-6 on each knee.\n\nFor anything you do, remember this: pull, don’t push!\nPull your abdominals in, but never do exercises that cause them to push out.\nIf you feel any pushing out, the exercises are too difficult for you at this time and will only aggravate your condition so skip it and move on.\nMANY abdominal exercises cause straining like this so be aware.\nOnce you have these stabilization exercises learned, try this workout plan to ease your way back into working out.\nDiastasis Recti Workout Plan\n\n\n\n\n\nPHASE 1:\nSpend a week or two focusing on the stabilization exercises listed above and some light walking.\nPHASE 2:\nAdd in some workouts that involve light weights with higher repetitions.\nKeep the walking. Keep the stabilization in mind.\nUse the stabilization techniques WHILE you lift weights! This is crucial!\nSpend a few weeks in this phase until you feel stronger. No extra ab work!\nPHASE 3:\nAdd in one intense cardio day per week.\nKeep everything from Phase 2, except start to challenge yourself with heavier weights and fewer reps.\nDon’t go too heavy all at once. Focus on small increments.\nKeep working on the stabilization!\nContinue to phase in more of what you are used to as you get stronger, but the stabilization never leaves.
