"Fall is my absolute favorite season—the cozy clothing, cool weather and changing leaves are all spectacular in and of themselves, but I have a particular fascination with the food. Sweet potatoes and honeycrisp apples are at their peak, figs sweeten up the dessert menu and I’m pretty sure I use ground cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger on running rotation for about three months straight. However, I don’t think there is a single food that represents fall better than pumpkin. Everyone at Team GHU shares a deep love for all things pumpkin, most of all Chris. Pumpkin spice lattes, overnight pumpkin spice oatmeal, pumpkin hummus, pumpkin pancakes, the list goes on. But often these recipes use only a portion of a pumpkin, i.e. the puree that you buy from the store. So I took the challenge of using a whole pumpkin and came up with three healthy and seriously delicious recipes you can make using a pumpkin in its entirety: the shell, the guts and the seeds. But first, let’s look at all of the health benefits of pumpkin so you can feel great about your favorite fall ingredient.\nRelated: 33 Yummy Pumpkin Recipes\n\nBesides being delicious, pumpkins are good for you. Here’s why:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. It can ward off wrinkles.\nGot your attention? Yes, pumpkin has anti-aging effects due to the presence of zinc and vitamin C which works to tighten and firm up the skin. It also contains Vitamin A which helps to speed up the renewal process of our cells as well as hydroxy acids which can help in the removal of dead skin. So, eat up, your tastebuds’ love may just be your skin’s best secret.\n2. It’s low calorie.\nAt only 30 calories per cup of pumpkin, pumpkins are very low calorie while also filling you up. This makes pumpkin a great option for weight loss. To aid in your weight loss efforts, swap a high caloric food out of your diet and replace it with pumpkin!\n3. It can boost your mood and help you sleep.\nIf you’ve struggled with getting good sleep, you may have turned to a melatonin supplement. But did you know that pumpkin can actually help you sleep? Pumpkin, particularly the seeds contain about 600mg of trytophan which in turn produces serotonin and melatonin in the body. Melatonin, as you many know, aids in getting a better night sleep, along with serotonin which also helps to regulate your mood and make you happier!\n4. It’s anti-cancer.\nIf you come across a food that is naturally orange in color (sorry, Cheetos, you don’t count), you can be sure that beta-carotene is involved. In the body, beta-carotene is converted into Vitamin A, which studies have shown can reduce your risk of certain types of cancers.\n5. It’s a great source of potassium.\nWhen people think of good sources of potassium, bananas often come to mind. And while that’s true, did you know pumpkin actually contains 33% more potassium than bananas? In fact, pumpkin seed contains roughly 588 mg of potassium. So next time you’re looking for a post-workout fuel that will aid in recovery and replenish your electrolytes, try a handful of pumpkin seeds or our delicious pumpkin pie smoothie.\n6. It’s rich in fiber to keep you full.\nWhether you’re consuming canned pumpkin, pumpkin seeds or boiled, raw pumpkin, all sources will give you a good boost of fiber. In fact, pumpkin is often recommended as a natural treatment for constipation as 1 cup of canned pumpkin boast 7.1 grams of fiber. And along with it’s digestive benefits, fiber also causes you to feel fuller for longer which means you’re less likely to overeat.\n7. It’s heart healthy.\nAnother benefit of all that fiber? It can lower your risk of coronary heart disease according to studies conducted on high-fiber diets. Pumpkin seeds are also rich sources of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, magnesium, zinc and antioxidants which are beneficial for heart health.\n8. It can boost vision.\nAs a major source of vitamin A, namely 200% of the recommended daily intake, pumpkin has also ben credited to boost your vision. The presence of the antioxidants, lutein and zeaxanthin, can also help prevent cataracts.\n9. It can reduce blood glucose levels.\nPumpkin has been touted as one of the best foods for diabetics due to it’s content of Vitamin A and C as well as the iron and unsaturated fats found in the seeds. Wed MD cites that certain scientific studies have even shown pumpkin to “reduce blood glucose levels, improve glucose tolerance and increase the amount of insulin the body produces.”\nNow that you know how amazing pumpkins are, here are three recipes to use up every ounce of your pumpkin!
