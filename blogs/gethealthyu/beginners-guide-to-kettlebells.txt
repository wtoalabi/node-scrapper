It is quite different than working with dumbbells and barbells, which provide a more static, methodical type of training.\nKettlebell training is a more fluid, motion-based and dynamic form of exercise that taps into your central nervous system and relies on the activation of multiple muscles for each and every movement.\nKettlebells also strengthen your muscles and burn fat and calories by tapping into your cardio system. Win, win! But wait, there’s more! Check out these amazing kettlebell benefits:\n\nImproved Strength\nImproved Coordination\nImproved Balance and Flexibility\nImproved Cardiovascular Health\nIncreased Range of Motion\nTime-Efficient\n\nThat last benefit – being time-efficient- is one that catches the attention of most people. Time is precious and our lives are busier than ever. If you can get more from your workout in less time, then that’s a no-brainer.\nAccording to the American Council on Exercise, kettlebells can provide a higher intensity workout than the usual strength training routine in a shorter amount of time. This is because kettlebell training simultaneously works your cardio endurance, strength, balance and flexibility.\nUsing the kettlebell helps you perform a greater range of motion and activate more muscles with each movement.\nLet’s take a look at the different parts of the kettlebell, how to use it, and what you need to do in order to get a safe, effective workout in less time.\nRelated: Beginner’s Guide To Strength Training\n\nKettlebells for Beginners\nKettlebells are weighted balls with a handle, which allow the weight to swing and move as you move it from place to place.\nUnlike the dumbbell, which has a fixed position – equal on both sides – the kettlebell allows for more movement, a bigger range of motion, and the activation of more muscles.\nThe Parts of a Kettlebell\nKettlebell Features\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHandle: Most common spot to hold, so you can swing the bell and pass it from hand to hand.\nHorns: Alternate grip, especially if you are holding the bell upside down.\nBase: The heaviest part of the bell. Gripping it here provides more stability.\n\nKettlebell Vs. Dumbbell\n\n\n\n\n\nSo given a choice should you go with kettlebells or dumbbells? The answer is… both! Don’t think of it as an “either/or” situation, but consider that both are good in different ways.\nDumbbells are excellent when you are looking for pure strength training and building muscle. Chest press, squat, tricep kickbacks, mid-back rows… there are countless exercises available to you if you know how to use them.\nPerhaps known for isolation moves like bicep curls, keep in mind that dumbbells are also great for multi-joint exercises and power moves as well.\nIn addition, dumbbells are easy to grip and reliable when you hold them. Due to this, there are many moves you can perform safely with dumbbells that you cannot do with the kettlebell.\nKettlebells are also great for strength training but they give you the option for fluid, functional moves. The type of movement that can be done with the kettlebell is more dynamic in nature.\nFor instance, a squat with dumbbells should be done in a steady, slow and controlled way. On the other hand, a kettlebell swing is done with power and in constant motion. It is faster in nature.\nThis brings on the other benefit of kettlebell training: cardiovascular benefits. You easily get a cardio workout when you go through a kettlebell series.\nThe dynamic nature of the movement gets your heart rate up quickly. This can happen with dumbbells as well, but kettlebells are designed for this effect.\n\nWhat Muscles Do Kettlebells Work?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no limit to the muscles kettlebells work. They can work virtually any muscle that you decide you want to target. However, the primary targets of many kettlebell exercises–especially the kettlebell swing–are hips, glutes, hamstrings and core.\nSo let’s say you want to add triceps to the mix. You pick up that kettlebell, raise it overhead, then lower slowly back behind your head and press it up for a tricep overhead press.\nWant some mid-back definition? Hold the kettlebell, hinge forward and pull the kettlebell to your hip bone for a mid-back row.\nIf there’s a muscle you’re ready to work, there is a kettlebell move to meet your needs!\nHow many calories does a kettlebell workout burn?\nIt’s a torcher! A kettlebell workout can burn up to 20 calories per minute – as much as running a 6-minute mile! That’s insane!\n\nWhat Size Kettlebell Should I Get?\nThe weight you choose for your kettlebell is going to depend on several factors including your fitness level, size and strength ability.\nHowever, it is recommended that the average woman start out with a 15-pound kettlebell for the larger muscle movement exercises. If you are a kettlebell beginner, you can always start lighter. If you are an athletic woman, you can likely go up to 20; don’t be afraid to go heavy.\nMen can go slightly heavier starting at 20 pounds for the average male and 25 for an athletic man.\nFor a single joint move like tricep presses, you may need to go lighter. On the other hand, for something like a two-handed deadlift you may need to go heavier.\nUltimately a kettlebell user will end up owning more than one set!\n\nUsing Kettlebells\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing that is extremely important when deciding to train with kettlebells is to learn good form! Do not go into kettlebell training without some sort of tutorial whether live from a certified trainer or via online training from a qualified professional.\nIndeed, poor understanding of the use of kettlebells can lead to injury just as it can with weight training. There are basic techniques to keep in mind and check out the video below demonstrating the proper form for a kettlebell swing:\nProper Kettlebell Techniques:\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nCore Comes First: Before you begin to swing those bells, tighten up your low abs and keep them pulled in the entire time.\nImagine sliding on a tight pair of jeans and how you pull in the muscles in order to zip those jeans. This muscle activation will protect your lower back and define your abs.\nGood Posture: Be sure to keep your shoulders pulled back and down, chest lifted and, again, abs pulled in tight. Posture is extremely important.\nA good rule of thumb is that your body follows your eyes. If you look straight ahead you will likely be more apt to keep a long spine. If you look at the floor, your back will hunch over to match that.\nPowerful, Controlled Movement: While it might look uncontrolled from the outside, you are always moving in a controlled motion. If you can originate the movement from your glutes, legs and core, everything else will stay aligned and safe.\nUse a Pro: As stated before, your best bet is to get a professional to help you learn how to use the kettlebells at first.\nTry a class, hire a trainer or follow along with our Raise Some Bell workouts on Get Healthy U TV.
