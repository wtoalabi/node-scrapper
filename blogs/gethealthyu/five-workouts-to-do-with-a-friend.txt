"You know the saying, it takes two to tango? It applies to more than just a ballroom floor. While doing things solo is great, throwing a partner into the mix certainly has its benefits. We can’t be on our A-game all the time, and when we’re not, having someone else around serving as an accountability partner who won’t let you hit the snooze button, may be key to success. It also adds a new level of fun to fitness. They say two is better than one, and when it comes to workouts, this can definitely be true for many! Research even shows the positive effects partner workouts can have on each individual’s fitness and health.\nThere are plenty of innovative ways you can up your workout game with a friend. Here are our top five partner workouts for you to try:\n1. Yoga:\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: TheSkinnyBreezy.com\nWhile yoga is centuries old, this style of partner yoga, often referred to as AcroYoga, has made waves in recent years. It promotes trust in your partner, whether it be a significant other, a friend or a stranger you’re paired up with in class and allows you to think outside the box. With the support of another body, you’re able to bend, lift, twist, stretch and strengthen your body in ways you simply can’t do on your own.\n2. Strength-Training Moves:\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: PopSugar.com\nWhen it comes to this style of exercise, a little goes a long way, but the same old moves can grow tiresome and throw you into a plateau. To ensure you continue to work your muscles efficiently, do things differently! In this move, one partner holds a forearm plank while the other adds extra resistance with their body weight by putting their feet atop the other’s lower back while doing push-ups.\nLooking for a quick and easy workout to do?!

Resistance Training Moves\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: TheBootcampGirl.com\nResistance bands wrapped around your foot or tucked under a stable surface work great, but when you add another person into the mix, you get a whole different type of resistance. Work your back and arms by doing rows with a band and a friend. To get the most of this exercise, you and your partner will have to find a rhythm, another fun touch. Sitting back into a squat gets the lower half of your body involved as well. And because you’ll be rowing at the same time as your partner, the amount of tension on the band is essentially doubled.\n4. Weight Training\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: TheTalkTo.com\nWhile you might think of spotting your partner under the bar in terms of partner-oriented weight training, it’s time to think outside the box. For instance, doing sit-ups can get tedious after a while. You can lose form, patience and forget your count. Grab a friend and a medicine ball and work your core with some added weight. Simply lay on your back with your knees bent, and as you come up for your sit-up, your partner will toss the ball your way. Elongate the body by stretching your hands and the ball over your head as you lay back down, and once you come up again, you toss the ball to your partner.\n5. Cardio\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: Buzzle.com\nWhen a casual jog just won’t cut it, try brushing up on your jump roping skills with partner jumps. Rhythm is key. Jump in unison, pushing each other to jump higher and faster using a longer rope. You can also try frog jumps, where you bounce together as well, and then switch to a straddle swing to do a side swing. The partner in front will duck underneath the others legs with the next skip, doing the straddle and side swings and switching sides back and forth.
