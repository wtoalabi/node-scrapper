"When it comes to healthy eating, including more plants in your diet is always a good choice.\nFrom being friendlier on your wallet and waistline to cutting down on animal products, people often choose a plant-based diet based on a variety of factors.\nBut before we dive into your 5 -day plant-based meal plan, let’s discuss what specifically a plant-based diet looks like.\nWhat Is A Plant-Based Diet?\nThere seem to be some differing opinions out there, but here at Get Healthy U, we believe that a plant based diet means including as many whole and minimally refined plant options in your diet as possible while limiting highly refined flours and sugars, dairy products and animal protein.\nNotice, we do include a couple animal protein options in the below meal plan as we believe meat can still be a part of a healthy plant-based diet, and it can be difficult for many (ahem, husbands) to go completely meat-free the entire week, but it’s definitely not the focal point.\nThis 5-day plant-based meal plan we created is full of delicious vegetables that give your body the nutrition it needs without lacking flavor. Plus, each dinner delivers tons of variety, from soups and salads to stir fry and burgers (yes, burgers!).\n\nWhat Are The Benefits of a Plant-Based Diet?\nAs mentioned, people choose to abide by a plant-based diet for a number of reasons. Here are just a few reasons to incorporate more plants into your meals:\nEating more (and mostly) plants:\n\nCan aid in weight loss\nIs less expensive\nCuts down on land and water use\nCan help ward off disease\nImproves heart health\nReduces animal slaughter\nImproves skin appearance and elasticity\n\nSounds like a pretty good list, right?
