"As you may know, Team GHU loves fitness fashion. Several of you have written to us and asked us to include the best plus-size activewear in our reviews. Ask and you shall receive. After all, everybody deserves to feel cute and comfortable when they sweat it out, right? We agree that many of the activewear companies are missing the boat by eliminating plus sizes. Thankfully, these 13 brands have awesome plus-size workout clothing that work with your body, not against it.\nJuno Active\n\n\n\n\nWhether you want to swim, run, play tennis, or do yoga, Juno Active has the gear to hook your workout up. We especially love their QuikWik line of activewear that’s made with moisture wicking fabric to keep you dry and comfortable.\nTorrid\n\n\n\n\nBe bold with the fun and flirty styles from Torrid. They’ll make you feel your best, even during a workout. Pick your size and take your pick. You can’t go wrong with any of their workout wear.\nLivi Active by Lane Bryant\n\n\n\n\nLivi Active is like Lane Bryant’s more fun, more popular younger sister. The patterns are bold and the styles are flattering. You’ll want everything!\nZella by Nordstrom’s\n\n\n\n\nThis is our pick for the brand that can easily take you from workout to hangout. From leggings with mesh panels, to pretty pastel zip-ups, each piece is chic enough for the streets and the studio.\nOld Navy\n\n\n\n\nGood ole Old Navy doesn’t disappoint with its affordable but high-quality plus-size activewear line.
