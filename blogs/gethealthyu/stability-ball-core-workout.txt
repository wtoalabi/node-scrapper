"One of the most notable advancements in the fitness world over the last 10 years is the progress we’ve made in understanding the importance of our core. Experts have recognized the importance of full core training not only as a tummy flattener, but as a back strengthener and crucial part of functional body movement, too. A strong core helps you bend, stretch, twist, and lift. For most people, your core plays in integral part of most every movement all day long – even healthy sitting! Included with all of this new knowledge has been a wealth of new and advanced methods for core training. We’ve ventured far beyond the crunches and sit ups and into the world of planks, rotations and balance challenges. But for this workout, it’s all about the stability ball.\nThe stability ball might just be one of the best tools around for giving you new strength in your core fitness. The ball provides a dimension of instability making not only the target muscles work harder, but additional smaller muscles and fibers surrounding the core kick in to help keep you stable. It truly is a wonder tool for the core!\nChoose the proper size by sitting on top of the stability ball and looking for your knees to come straight our or just slightly below your hip bones.
