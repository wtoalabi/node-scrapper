"To stay safe while still enjoying the benefits of resistance training, take a seat. \n\n\n\nSeated exercises are a great option for any senior who’s intimidated by resistance training. If you’re wobbly on your feet, for example, trying to curl a set of dumbbells while keeping your balance can be tough. If you’re not careful, you could wind up falling and hurting yourself. And that’s definitely not what you want from exercise.\n\n\n\nBecause make no mistake, resistance training is not optional if your overall health matters to you. Resistance training helps keep your heart healthy, bones and muscles strong, weight under control, and mood at optimal levels. \n\n\n\nSo, if you’re looking for a low-impact way to get your resistance training done, seated exercises are the way to go.\n\n\n\nKeep reading to learn more about the benefits of seated exercises for seniors. Then, try out the 10 seated exercises we’d recommend for any senior looking to get strong and fit.\n\n\n\nThe Benefits of Seated Exercises for Seniors\n\n\n\nHere are just a handful of the perks of seated exercises:\n\n\n\nMore accessible if you have limited balance or mobility: Standing exercises can be risky if your balance or mobility is less-than-great. While it’s important to practice standing exercises to improve your balance and mobility, you may need a safer movement option if you’re exercising by yourself or just starting to lift weights. Seated exercises allow you to reap the benefits of resistance training without fear of falling down and breaking a bone.  Build lean muscle: The sad truth is most of us lose 25% of our valuable muscle mass by our 70th birthday. Thankfully, seated exercises are one of your best options for rebuilding any lost muscle — especially if they incorporate resistance bands or dumbbells. And adding muscle will make everyday life a lot easier, from carrying heavy bags to getting up from a chair. Increase blood circulation: Seated exercises wake up your muscles and other tissues, moving blood and other fluids through your limbs in the process. Boosting blood flow is a big deal, especially as we get older and more sedentary. Strength training will also challenge your heart, which helps to improve cardiovascular health.Improve joint health: Moving your limbs as you lift weights encourages your joints to self-lubricate. This will go a long way toward improving range of motion and reducing stiffness and other joint soreness. Remember, motion is lotion! Prevent bone fractures: Osteoporosis — and the broken bones that go with it — is a common symptom of aging. By challenging your muscles through seated exercises, you can build greater bone strength, which may prevent painful fractures. \n\n\n\nCan You Lose Belly Fat Sitting in a Chair?\n\n\n\nIt’s not uncommon to pack on a few pounds around your midsection as you age — blame a slowed metabolism and decrease in energy-burning muscle tissue. Aside from the annoyance that carrying extra weight can bring, it also increases your risk of chronic illnesses like diabetes and heart disease.\n\n\n\nSeated exercises — like the ones below — may help you lose those extra pounds. Just make sure you do them consistently to see maximum benefits. Try to work hard enough to get your heart pumping during the exercises.  \n\n\n\nThe 10 Best Seated Exercises for Seniors\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve rounded up several of the top seated exercises for seniors.
