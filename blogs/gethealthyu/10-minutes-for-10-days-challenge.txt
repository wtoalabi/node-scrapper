Using only bodyweight moves, this cardio circuit is a great way to finish up a solid week of workouts.\nWhy 10 minutes?\nPlain and simple, 10 minutes is better than 0 minutes. And, if we’re being honest with ourselves, we all have 10 minutes to spare at some point during the day. A 10-minute at-home workout can be done while listening to your favorite podcast, while your dinner cooks in the oven, or while you’re also watching your favorite TV show. \nIf you’re new to working out, these 10-minute workouts are a great place for you to start. Why? Because they’re all a preview of different types of workouts, so you can really figure out what type of workouts you enjoy. From pilates to yoga to HIIT to cardio, we’ve got 10-minute workouts that will kick your butt and help you find out which avenue of fitness you enjoy (though we encourage you to maintain a good amount of variety in your workouts!). \nCan 10 minutes a day actually make an impact on my fitness? \nAbsolutely! We wouldn’t have made this challenge OR these killer free 10-minute at-home workouts if 10 minutes couldn’t make a difference. Not only can you get a totally butt-kicking workout in 10 minutes, but so much of your fitness journey is about forming (and maintaining) great fitness habits. By working out for just 10 minutes, you maintain that consistency despite being pressed for time. You won’t feel like you’ve “fallen off the wagon” or need to “get back on the horse.” Rather, you’re keeping yourself right on track. \nIn addition to the sheer convenience and schedule-friendly nature of a 10-minute at home workout, there are genuine health benefits to even a brief burst of movement. There are countless studies that show workouts ranging between 7 and 15 minutes. According to Women’s Health Magazine’s interview with Lauren Stobbie, a certified strength and conditioning specialist in Florida, doing bursts of brief exercise can be just as effective as a longer workout all in one sitting. These “micro workouts” can help boost your metabolism, burn fat, and gain muscle; all leading contributors to overall weight loss.\nSo what are you waiting for?
