"This is a sponsored post written on behalf of Champion. All opinions are my own.\nDid you know that the sports bra was only invented 40 years ago?! That’s within my lifetime, people! Before the sports bra, a lack of physical support was a barrier to female participation in sports and athletic endeavors. I mean, can you imagine doing a HIIT workout in a regular bra or even going for a run? How uncomfortable! The first sports bra, branded Jogbra, was marketed and sold starting in 1977. And honestly, I can remember when I got my first one entering high school in 1979. But in 1994, Jogbra was rebranded as Champion, which is why I’m super excited to be partnering with Champion for this post in celebration of their 40th Anniversary. They truly are a champion in my book for the invention of a daily wardrobe staple in my life.\nThe thing I really love about Champion sports bras is that they continue to innovate their sports bra product assortment to support the wide range of women’s bodies and breast sizes. Any of you women who have had babies know that when that baby is born, your boobs take on a life of their own. Twenty-five years ago was my first experience with this situation and I finally understood what my well-endowed friends were complaining about. I wanted so badly to go for a run (my favorite form of exercise back then) but my post-partum breasts posed a problem! I had to go out and buy myself this rather new concept of a maximum-support sports bra. I never had any sympathy for my high school friends who said they didn’t do sports because of their big boobs. Suddenly I understood. That was the 80’s and 90’s… fast forward to today, and a lot has changed. Champion offers a super expansive line of sports bra styles that range from moderate to maximum support and are ideal for the most intense workouts or everyday needs. I actually prefer a sports bra to a regular bra on a daily basis and I think lots of women would agree with me.  Today’s Champion sports bra allows women to increase the intensity of their workouts no matter their shape or cup size while still being confident you’ve got the support you need!\nRelated: The Beginner’s Guide To HIIT\nAnd in honor of their 40th Anniversary, I’ve created a “Workout Like a Champion” high-intensity workout below while wearing Champion’s dedicated anniversary sports bra to showcase how awesome this exclusive red bra really is! This workout involves jumping and it’s no problem for “the girls” when you are wearing a comfortable sports bra.
