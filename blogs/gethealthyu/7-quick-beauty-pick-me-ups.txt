"In a world where it’s hard to find time for a spa day, creating your own spa night at home is a great (and cheaper!) alternative.\nYou don’t have to go to a luxury spa to experience luxury treatments. As we age, it becomes even more essential to take care of our skin to look and feel our best. Because when we look well-rested, fresh-faced, and youthful, it can make us feel that way, too. When you’re stressed, in pain, or just need a break from the daily grind, it’s time for an at-home spa night! \nWhether you use a facial roller and some scented candles or just go with the basics of a hot bath and oil diffuser, an at-home spa night has never been easier. Below, we discuss how to get started with an at-home spa night that will have you feeling relaxed and refreshed.\nFacial Roller\n\n\n\n\n\nFacial rollers are part of the new at-home beauty routine. When beauty routines change drastically during the global pandemic, many turned to DIY products for self-care and to bring the serenity of the spa into the home, even if just for a few minutes. Using a facial roller is so easy, we think this beauty pick-me-up will stick around.\nA facial roller is a unique kind of facial massager that works to improve blood circulation, reduce muscle tension in the face, and deliver nutrients deep into your skin.\nFacial rollers are particularly useful for lymphatic drainage, minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, alleviating discomfort from sinuses or allergies, reducing acne flare-ups, and speeding up post-workout recovery.\nPlus, there are so many beautiful options to choose from: pick up a jade facial roller, rose quartz, or an ice roller feels fantastic after a sweaty HIIT workout.\nTo elevate your at-home spa night, try this vibrating facial roller. This rose quartz face roller also comes with an eye press.\nHow to use a facial roller\n\nTo use a facial roller, we recommend you prep your skin by cleansing and prepping with a serum or light moisturizer. \nThen begin by lightly rolling from the center of your face outward. Focus on your forehead moving outward from eyebrows to the scalp. \nWhen facial rolling at the chin and jawline, roll gently toward your collarbone.\n\nGua Sha\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you love facial rollers, you need to check out gua sha. Gua sha is a facial trend in the wellness world but the history of gua sha goes back centuries. It’s a technique where a person uses their hand or specially shaped stone to apply pressure and friction to the skin, causing it to change color in the process. \nThe application of gua sha causes blood flow to increase which aids circulation while removing toxins from the body through sweat glands on your face. Studies have shown that gua sha can be an effective treatment for arthritis.\nHow to get started with gua sha for your at-home spa night: \n\nFind a gua sha tool and a massage oil or lotion. \nYou can use any sort of tool for this technique–from ancient Chinese kidney stones to modern plastic spoons. \nA traditional gua sha tool is made from smooth material like a walnut shell, granite, or marble.\nNext, gently rub your skin with the edge of the gua sha tool so that you’re pressing against different muscles. Another gua sha tip is to follow the grain of your muscles.\n\nYou’ll notice that when you run your fingers over the skin, it will feel more heated and rougher than normal. This is because blood flow has increased to this section of the body due to all that pressure!\nSheet Masks\nOf course, you can never go wrong with a sheet mask for your spa night. A sheet mask is a pre-packaged cloth face mask that can be used as a treatment or just for relaxation. \nSheet masks are infused with a variety of substances ranging from antioxidants to vitamins and more, depending on what you need most! Popular sheet masks include the Dr Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Aqua Splash Hydrating Mask (for hydration), or Peter Thomas Roth.\nSheet mask tips:\nTry to find masks that are made from natural ingredients, which is especially important if you have sensitive skin. \nThe best sheet mask will usually be labeled for the specific type of problem it’s designed to address (e.g., acne or aging). Here are some other things I recommend as a rule:\n\nLook for sheet masks that have a cotton or silk fabric\nAvoid masks with added fragrance, especially if you have sensitive skin\nMasks that contain charcoal are great for oily skin and may be soothing to redness and inflammation\nLook for masks designed to hydrate the skin (e.g., by containing glycerin)\nA few of my favorite all-natural brands include:\n\nLaneige, which is well known for its soothing properties\nEtude House’s line of masks (I love their gold and pearl masks)\nBenton’s sheet masks, which are some of the least expensive on Amazon. I recommend “brightening” or “anti aging.”\n\n\nWe love to store our sheet masks in the refrigerator for a cool refresher after a good workout.\n\nScalp Brush\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons to give yourself a scalp massage. It promotes circulation, encourages your hair to grow, removes scalp buildup that causes dandruff, and it’s incredibly relaxing. A clean scalp means thicker and healthier-looking hair. \nSo for days when you’re at home, and you have the urge to de-stress, reach for a scalp brush. \nHow To Use A Scalp Brush\nGently move the scalp brush in circular motions all over your head in the shower after you have lathered up with the conditioner.\nTo leave your scalp feeling clean and relaxed after your at-home spa night, try this scalp brush. We love it because it’s so affordable, and you get a thorough cleansing, even if you have thick or long hair.\nAt Home Red Light Therapy\nRed light therapy is one of the hottest at home spa trends and we’re encouraged by the research. You may have seen red light therapy at a local med spa, but today you can buy red light masks, red light bulbs, and even red light panels to hang in your bathrooms. \nRed light therapy research \nRecent studies have shown red light therapy has been correlated with anti-aging. According to famed dermatologist, Dr. Dennis Gross, red light therapy works by triggering cells deep within to increase metabolic activity. This, in turn, leads to an uptick in collagen production. Collagen, of course, is what we all want for that plump, youthful appearance. \nRed light therapy for weight loss \nYou might even be surprised to know that red light therapy has also been linked to weight loss. Red light therapy for weight loss has been studied and the results showed that study participants that incorporated red light therapy into a regimen were able to reduce their waist circumference.\nSo if you’re intrigued and ready to get started with at-home red light therapy – head to Amazon! Decide if you want to choose a bulb, face mask, or a LED red light panel. Be sure to read the reviews and give it a try. \nMassage Gun Percussive Therapy\nPercussive therapy is another spa night trend that is worth including. Brands of percussive massagers like Theragun have taken the wellness world by storm. These high-tech devices come with a handy handle and ergonomic grip, so you can target all of your sore spots.\nPercussive massage guns work by emitting sound waves at a certain frequency that agitates the skin and underlying tissues. This stimulates blood circulation, which in turn helps deliver nutrients to cells below the surface of your skin as well as break up scar tissue and reduce muscle inflammation.\nThese massagers are specially designed to alleviate muscle pain through deep tissue vibration. Note – you may not be used to that sensation if this is the first time you’ve tried it!\nThe best part about these percussive massagers is that they’re gentle on the joints and easy to use.\nEssential Oils and Diffusers\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential oils are a great way to make your at-home spa night complete. The history of essential oils is ambiguous, but it is believed that these oils were first extracted by Ancient Egyptian and Chinese practitioners of herbal medicine. Essential oils are diluted in a carrier oil such as jojoba or coconut to create a blend.\nThere are many benefits to using essential oils as they have the ability to heal a person’s physical ailments in addition to their emotional ones.\nThe best essential oils for relaxation include lavender, chamomile, and ylang-ylang. \nDid you know that essential oils can also help wake you up? For a morning workout boost after your at home spa night, try peppermint, eucalyptus or lemon balm oil.\nNote: not all essential oils are the same. Our favorite brands are Saje Wellness, Eden Botanicals, Doterra, Young Living, and Thrive Market.\nWhich diffuser should you buy?\nThe diffuser is another important tool for a successful at-home spa night. There are two types of diffusers: ultrasonic and nebulizing. \nAn ultrasonic diffuser uses high frequency sound waves to break up the essential oils into tiny particles that can be inhaled easily while a nebulizer disperses the oil in mist form with air pressure.\nEssential oil tips\n\nDon’t apply any essential oils to a broken skin surface because it can cause irritation.\nAlways dilute your essential oil before applying them topically, with water, coconut oil or other carrier liquids. This is especially important for people who are pregnant and have sensitive skin.\nIt’s best not to use the same essential oil on two consecutive days, because they can build up in the skin and lead to a potential sensitization.\nConsult with your doctor or medical professional before using essential oils if you have issues like epilepsy, cancer, severe allergies, high blood pressure, or diabetes.\n\nEpsom Salt Bath or Salt Scrub\nAn Epsom salts bath involves adding salt to your bath water and soaking for about 20 minutes. The Epsom salts are rich in magnesium which can help with muscle soreness, relaxation, and detoxification!\nWhile we’re on the topic of baths, a salt scrub is perfect for an at-home spa night. Sitting down to scrub your skin is not an easy task when you’ve got a little bit of everything going on underneath the surface – so make it easier by doing a salt scrub. \nHow to make a spa night salt scrub\n\nSimply mix together equal parts salt, olive oil and almond milk in a jar or bowl. \nApply the mixture to your skin with a sponge or loofah for anywhere from five minutes up to twenty, then rinse off!\n\nExfoliating Gloves\nIf you’re not a bath person, you can also take your at-home spa night to the shower. In the shower, use exfoliating gloves. Exfoliating gloves are an easy way to gently scrub away dead skin cells and excess oils.\nSimply rub a little soap or shower gel on the gloves, then massage in circular motions over your body. You can buy exfoliating gloves at most drug or beauty stores, and they are also great for use on your arms, legs, and chest. Be extra careful around your delicate facial areas.\nHair Clay Mask\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you’re in the shower, you can also take care of your hair as part of your night of self-care. Here’s an at-home all-natural treatment you will love. \nOne of the biggest trends in hair right now is a hair clay mask. A hair clay mask is a great way to condition and style your hair with natural ingredients. \nHow to make a hair clay mask\n\nSimply mix together one tablespoon of clay, a few drops of essential oil (I recommend lavender or ylang-ylang)\nAdd water until it’s at the consistency you like. \nApply as necessary on any part of your body, it’s fantastic for removing impurities from your scalp and hair follicles.\n\nBenefits of a hair clay mask\n\nIt’s a great way to condition and style your hair with natural ingredients – you’ll feel like you’re at a high end spa!\nIt’s easy to use. You can’t mess this up. Just put it on, rinse out, and enjoy the results!\nit’s all-natural!
