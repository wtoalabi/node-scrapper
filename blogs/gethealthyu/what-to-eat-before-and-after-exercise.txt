"When it comes to getting healthy, you probably already know that nutrition is just as important as exercise, but did you know that what you eat after a workout is incredibly important too?\nWhat you eat after your run, Pilates class, or strength training session can either fuel or sabotage your success. And no one wants their hard work to go to waste!\nRead on to discover why this is important, why timing is everything when it comes to fueling your workouts and what you should eat after exercise.\nWhy You Need To Eat After Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise that when you work out, you use up energy and oftentimes lots of it! Eating after exercise is critical to not only get your energy back up but also to aid in muscle recovery.\nWhen we work out, we break down our muscle fibers creating little tiny tears. Our body then has to go to work repairing these tears, which is what strengthens our muscles!\nIn order to maximize this process, we need to fuel our body with the right foods. So, what foods are those? Read on.\nThe Basics: Protein, Carbs & Fat\nIf you’ve been following me for a while, you’ve heard me talk about macronutrients: that is, protein, carbs, and fat.\nOur body needs all three to survive, but what are we looking for post-workout?\nIdeally, protein & carbs.\nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter your workout, you need to refuel with a clean source of protein. If it’s not mealtime yet, make sure you’re getting it in the form of a snack.\nProtein gives your body needed amino acids in order to help rebuild the breakdown of muscles, as mentioned above.\nThe recommendation is 0.14–0.23 grams of protein per pound of body weight. For example, if you’re a 140-pound woman, you would want to consume about 20-32 grams of protein post-workout.\nEating enough protein will help your muscles repair themselves so all that strength training actually works!\nCarbohydrates\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also want to be sure to include carbohydrates in your post-workout recovery.\nGlycogen, stored in your body’s liver and muscles to provide the body with energy as blood glucose level decrease, are used while exercising. Thus, it’s important to replenish them by eating carbs.\nThe amount of carbs you’re looking to consume is about 0.5–0.7 grams per pound of body weight. Again, to use our previous example, a 140-pound woman would be looking to consume is about 70-98 grams of carbs.\nCarbs to protein should be around a 4:1 or 3:1 ratio.\nA quick note on carbs: not all carbs are created equal. Try to look for whole-grain sources of carbs along with fruits and vegetables.\nA slice of whole wheat bread will give your body lasting energy rather than the sugar crash of white starches. For additional examples of healthy carbs, see below.\nFat\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile fat is a critical macronutrient to daily life and eating fat can actually help you lose weight, protein and carbs are ultimately most beneficial to your post-workout recovery.\nSmall amounts of fat alongside these other macronutrients will likely not do any harm, but should be the main focus.\nWhy Timing Is Everything When It Comes To Fueling Your Workouts\nAs far as post-workout snacks go, within 45 minutes of your workout and up to 2 hours after is the perfect time to refuel with a combination of protein and carbs.\nAs you’ve learned, that winning combo is what helps speed up your recovery time and replenishes your glycogen stores.\nA quick note: if you finish up your workout and it’s time for a main meal like lunch or dinner, go ahead and just eat that (no need to double up on a snack!).\nRelated: Do You Have Portion Distortion?  \nAlso, listen to your body. If you only workout for 20 minutes, you likely don’t need to bookend it with snacks on either side.\nThe main goal is this: don’t go into any workout starving, but don’t feel the need to double up on meals before an intense class. If you’re not hungry or just ate, no need to eat again before your workout.\nPost-Workout Meal Ideas:\nThese 11 great post-workout meals and snacks will help refuel your body after exercise:\n1. Leafy greens with chicken or tuna\n\n\n\n\n\nTuna over leafy greens can serve as a snack or light meal option post-workout. Tuna, particularly the pouch version, is a super quick and convenient option that packs about 20 grams of protein per 3 ounces. And dark leafy greens are always a good choice. Greens such as kale and Swiss chard can help with exercise-induced inflammation and are loaded with antioxidants.\n2. Whey protein smoothie (with pineapple and ginger)\nA protein smoothie is a go-to for many athletes post-workout. You can also add whey protein to your smoothies as well as pineapple and ginger. Both pineapple and ginger act as anti-inflammatory agents, which work to fight off muscle soreness after an intense session in the gym and reduce exercise-induced inflammation.\n3. Cottage cheese with fruit\nCottage cheese is a great source of protein giving you 25 grams in just 1 cup – just the amount you need in our previous examples! Fruit also gives you the healthy carbs you’re looking for and is a super tasty treat over cottage cheese. Peaches are a GHU team favorite!\n4. Whole grain tortilla with turkey, hummus, and grains\nIf your training falls around midday, a whole grain tortilla with turkey and hummus is a great lunch option. You’ll get healthy carbs from your whole grain tortilla and a good does of protein from both turkey and hummus. Throw in some crunchy veggies too for good measure: carrot sticks, cucumber, lettuce, etc.!\n5. Hardboiled eggs\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get your needed post-workout protein, hard-boiled eggs are a great way to go. They’re convenient, can be made ahead of time and contain 6 grams of protein per egg.\n6. Chicken with quinoa/brown rice\nIf you’re looking for a more hefty meal post-workout, lean protein with grains makes a perfect dinner. Quinoa and brown rice are both healthy carbohydrate packed foods and surprisingly quinoa delivers on protein-front as well with about 8 grams of protein per cup. Add some roasted veggies to round out your meal and feel great about the fuel you’re giving your body to maximize your hard work.\n7. Whole grain cereal with soy milk\nThe whole grain cereal is a smart carbohydrate packed with fiber, B vitamins, and more. Soy milk can be a good replacement for those who are lactose intolerant or sensitive, plus it contains enzymes and riboflavin to help restore lost energy after your workout.\n8. Omelet with fresh fruit\nHeaded home post-workout? Whip up a quick omelet for yourself with some eggs, milk and cheese. Got some veggies in the fridge? Throw those in as well. Serve it up alongside some fresh fruit for a perfect protein & carbohydrate-rich meal you’ll love.\n9. Greek yogurt with mix-ins\nA typical container of Greek yogurt contains 17 grams of protein and about 6 grams of carbs. Throw in some almonds and dark chocolate and you have yourself the perfect post-workout treat.\n10. Apple slices with nut butter\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother great healthy and tasty snack option post-workout is apple slices (25g of carbs per medium apple) and a nut butter of choice. Of course, peanut butter is the go-to (8 grams per two tablespoons), but almond butter is also a delicious alternative (7 grams per two tablespoons). Cashew butter can also be found in our pantry for a unique spin on the classic (6 grams per two tablespoons).\n11. Chocolate milk\nBelieve it or not, chocolate milk is beloved by long-distance runners logging serious miles. Why? Well, for one it rehydrates, and two, it contains a four-to-one carb to protein ratio critical for restoring glycogen and rebuilding muscle. Chocolate milk is also a good source of B-vitamins which many athletes find helpful for exercise performance and muscle repair.\nPS: Don’t Forget To Hydrate!\nNo matter when you work out or the form of exercise you choose to do, stay hydrated. Water is essential to keep your body working safely and productively. Here are some of the health benefits of water:\n\nPrevents dehydration\nHelps eliminate toxins from your body\nImproves digestion\nHelps to naturally suppress appetite\nHelps carry nutrients throughout your body\nAids in the metabolism of the stored fats in the body\nWater can help reduce the likelihood of back and joint pain\n\nNo matter what workout you do, fuel it with clean food and plenty of water.
