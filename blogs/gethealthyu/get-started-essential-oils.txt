"People have been using essential oils to cure ailments, relieve stress and promote overall wellness for centuries—and all over the globe. But what are they, exactly? And just what do they do? Consider this your beginner’s guide to essential oils; we’ll teach you how to get started with essential oils and how they can improve your day-to-day life.\nWhat Are Essential Oils And Where Did They Come From?\nIf you want to learn how to get started with essential oils, you first need to understand what they are. Essential oils aren’t technically oils at all; they’re actually plant compounds extracted from a plant’s flowers, leaves, roots, bark or peels. The earliest evidence of humans using plants to heal various ailments was discovered through cave paintings found in the Dordogne region of France that date back to 18,000 BCE. Ancient Egyptians were also among some of the first people to use essential oils as part of their medical practice, as well as for beauty treatments and food preparation.\nIn modern times, the potential healing effects of essential oils were rediscovered by Rene-Maurice Gattefosse—a man largely regarded as the father of modern aromatherapy. A French chemist, Gattefosse healed a bad hand burn with pure lavender oil in 1937 which spurred him to further examine other potential benefits of essential oils.\n\nWhat Do Essential Oils Do?\nOver the years, modern use of essential oils has reached the U.S, though it’s still not as readily accepted here as it is in European countries, where medical aromatherapy is extremely popular. Many physicians in Europe prescribe oils as part of a patient’s medical care, such as Dr. Wolfgang Steflitsch, a physician and vice president of the Austrian Association of Aromatherapy and Aroma Care.\n\n\n\n\nSteflitsch notes that there is high-quality evidence that essential oils can help treat infections, provide relief from sleep problems and pain and improve anxiety and depression. We happen to love dabbing a bit of lavender on our wrists when we’re feeling stressed, or adding some eucalyptus to our bath to soothe a congested nose and chest.\nOf course, it’s best to consult your doctor with any medical condition you may have. But just like meditation, why not incorporate alternative therapies to help improve your day-to-da health\n5 Ways to Use Essential Oils\nThere are many ways to use essential oils, including adding a few drops to your bath water or body cream.
