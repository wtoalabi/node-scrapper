"Tabata. HIIT. Fartlek. To some, these words look like a foreign language. To those paying attention to fitness, these are the latest buzzwords that seem to have staying power, and they all refer to intervals! Many things in fitness come and go, but interval training is here to stay. Why? Because it’s one of the best ways to burn fat and lose weight.\nWhat Is Interval Training?\nInterval training is a type of workout where you alternate between high intensity (anaerobic) and lower intensity (aerobic) exercise. The amount of time spent in the intervals varies, but the goal of each anaerobic interval is to work hard enough to be breathless so that you don’t just want a break, you need it. The benefit of interval training is that it shortens your workout time while giving you better results. (HIIT and Tabata are both forms of interval training, and a “fartlek” refers to interval training in running where you alternate between intervals of a fast and slower pace. Pull that one out at your next dinner party….)\nHow Does Interval Training Help You Lose Weight?\nIf weight loss is your goal, you have to vary your workouts. Steady state workouts like walking, jogging, or cycling, are fantastic—but if you want to lose weight you’ll have to incorporate intervals. By pushing yourself to go as hard as you can for specific amounts of time, you end up working harder, not longer, which saves you tons of time. But not only that, studies show that interval training helps you burn more calories even after you’re done working out than you would after a steady-state cardio workout. This affect is called”afterburn” and it’s critical for weight loss. You want your metabolism to be revved up long after you’re done working out, not just during the workout itself.\nRelated: Why HIIT Is Good For Burning Fat \n10-Minute Interval Workout\nSo are you ready to get your heart pumping and burn some fat with this intense interval routine?
