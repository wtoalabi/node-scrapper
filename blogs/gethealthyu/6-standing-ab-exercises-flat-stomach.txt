"One thing is for sure: people are always looking for ways to tighten and tone their abs. No surprise, many complain about getting down on the floor and banging out a bunch of ab crunches. Well here’s a newsflash: working your core does not require that you lay down on a mat. Why would you want to work your core while standing? Plenty of reasons! Sometimes low back pain prevents us from lying on our backs. Knee pain can also prevent people from getting down to and up from the floor. But above all, sculpting your abdominals while standing engages more muscles than just your core, improves your posture and spinal alignment, and typically burns more calories than exercises that have you laying on your back. So what are you waiting for? Try these six standing ab exercises for a flat stomach today.\n1. Oblique Burner\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStand with feet a little wider than hip distance apart, knees bent and hands held behind the back of your head.\nBend to the right, reaching right hand toward floor behind your leg.
