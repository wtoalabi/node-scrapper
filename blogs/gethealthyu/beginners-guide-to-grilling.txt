So much flavor comes from the grill itself that you can actually keep it simple: olive oil, salt, pepper and maybe some herbs are all you need. Some of my favorite foods to put on the grill are vegetables like sweet potatoes, zucchini, and asparagus. And you can’t forget the meat! Chicken and salmon are two of my favorite proteins to cook on the grill as well.\nQuit peaking and no over flipping. Because if you’re looking, it ain’t cookin’. Go ahead and use a timer or a meat thermometer. My tip to not overcooking your meat is to take it off a few minutes before it’s done. While you prepare the rest of your food, your meat will finish cooking as it rests.\nClean up with the grill is a snap. No pots and pans to scrub. Keep it simple so you keep enjoying your guests, your family and the beautiful summer evening.\n\nReady to get started?
