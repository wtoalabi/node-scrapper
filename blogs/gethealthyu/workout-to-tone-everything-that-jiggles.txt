"We all have areas on our body we wish we could tighten or tone; whether its arm flab, a sagging backside, or thigh fat. But how do you go about “toning” and firming specific areas? First off, recognize that we all have areas on our body that maybe jiggle or sag a little and that’s 100% fine. No one is perfect—not even the models who have been photoshopped to make it look like they have 0% body fat. Furthermore, spot-reducing body fat doesn’t work. You need to start by losing weight all over, and then focusing on working the specific muscle group you want to tone up. Sound like something you’re up for? Then read on to learn how to tone up your body and get started with our 10-minute Total Body Toner.\nHow To Tone Your Body 101\nOk, so here’s the game plan. Like we said above, if you have areas on your body you want to tone up, you first need to lose the weight that’s covering the muscle. But remember: you can’t pick where you lose weight from on your body. It doesn’t work like that. You have to use cardio to lose weight all over, then specifically target the areas you want to strengthen and firm up with strength training moves.\nStep 1: Become A Cardio Queen\nIf you’re not doing it already, make sure you’re getting 150 minutes of heart-pumping cardio per week. Think jogging, hiking at a brisk pace, cycling, or doing bodyweight cardio moves. You can divide your minute up however you like, just get them in! If you don’t have a regular cardio routine, we have tons to chose from through GetHealthy U TV. Some favorites of mine are Cardio Kickboxing or Calorie Sizzler.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Pay Attention To Your Diet\nYou can’t out-train a bad diet, period. If you’re working out regularly but still eating frozen pizzas every night, you likely won’t see many results. Eat plenty of fresh veggies and fruits, lean protein, healthy fats, and whole grains. Limit dairy, sugar, and alcohol. You don’t need to eliminate them completely, but if your diet is currently heavy on those three things, you need to cut back. Psst:  If you’re feeling a little lost in terms of what do with your diet, read our Get Started with Clean Eating Guide and start making those small changes right away. \nStep 3: Tone, Baby, Tone!\nHere comes the fun part: building up the muscle that’s been hidden beneath the fat. You can either work different muscle groups on different days, or do workouts like the one we’re about to show you, which is a total-body muscle workout that will help you tone and tighten each muscle group.\n10-Minute Total-Body Toner \nReady to tone up?
