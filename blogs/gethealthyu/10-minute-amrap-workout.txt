"The number one excuse I hear from people about why they don’t workout is that they don’t have the time. Luckily, intervals and circuits are great ways to shorten up the length of your workouts and increase the intensity. While you may have heard of High Intensity Interval Training or Tabata, I bet you haven’t heard of another fun, fast, and challenging workout called an AMRAP.\n\nWhat Does AMRAP Mean?\nAMRAP is an acronym that stands for “as many rounds as possible” because it’s a type of circuit workout where—you guessed it—you perform as many rounds of a circuit as possible in a given amount of time. It likely originated in Crossfit classes as a fun circuit workout to perform in a group. AMRAP workouts string exercises together with no rest in between and they test your mental toughness, strength and stamina! AMRAP workouts are a class favorite for my group fitness classes—they “love to hate them!”—because they’re intense but burn MEGA calories.\nWhy are AMRAP Workouts Effective?\n\n\n\n\n\nAMRAP workouts incorporate not only strength training but cardiovascular endurance as well. By pushing yourself as hard as you can (within the realms of safety, of course) for an allotted amount of time, you’re going to shred fat and torch more calories than you would, say, doing a steady-state cardio activity like jogging or cycling. AMRAPS can easily be modified to work with all fitness levels but in most cases, they aren’t for the total newbie. The most important thing is that you get your mind in the game and push through for the allotted amount of time. Most AMRAPS tend to be between 5-30 minutes long. And obviously you will be able to push a little harder in a 3 minute AMRAP than a 20 or 30 minute AMRAP, which will require some pacing and mental toughness.\nRelated: The Best 10-Minute Workouts For Busy Days \nHow Do AMRAP Workouts Work?\nAn AMRAP workout goes like this: you have a certain number of reps of each exercise in the AMRAP. Once you have completed all the reps of the exercises, you go back to the start of the circuit and begin again. That counts as one round.\nThe aim is to perform as many rounds in the given time. AMRAPS are scored by the number of rounds you completed in the time frame. Due to the high intensity, these workouts are exhausting. So you want to remember to listen to your body and keep in mind that “good form trumps speed.” It’s better to do the exercises properly at a moderate pace at first instead of doing the exercises incorrectly at a fast pace.\nYour 10-Minute AMRAP Workout\nIn the case of AMRAP workouts like this one, you’ll perform the entire circuit (4 exercises) for as many rounds as possible in the allotted time—10 minutes. This means you’ll want to go as quickly as you can without sacrificing form. The more fit you become, the more rounds you’ll be able to get in. You can use the same AMRAP workout as a benchmark for how far you’ve come on your fitness journey; maybe now you get 4 rounds done in 10 minutes, but a few months from now you do 5 or 6!\nThis workout requires stamina, agility, and focus—you’ll get your heart pumping and calories burning in no time. This AMRAP contains four moves. Perform the entire circuit as many times as possible in 10 minutes; if you’re up for more, rest a minute or two and then try another 10 minutes.\nRegarding the weight of your dumbbells—you may want to have a few sets so if fatigue sets in you can still continue, using a lighter weight. Now start the clock, set your timer, hit that stopwatch—whatever you need to do—because 10 minutes are all you have to do this as many times as possible.
