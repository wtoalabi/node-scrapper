"In need of a fresh twist on your fitness routine? Dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells are all functional tools that offer a large range of exercise options, but a medicine ball can give your routine a whole different range of opportunities.\nYou see, a medicine ball can be tossed, rolled and even slammed into the ground—something its fitness cousins do not offer. This allows for a different range of motion, allowing you to work different muscle groups more effectively.\nWhy Use Medicine Balls?\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicine balls have been around for almost 3,000 years when Persian wrestlers trained with bladders that were filled with sand. In ancient Greece, the famous physician Hippocrates filled stuffed animal skins with sand to create medicine balls. His patients would throw the balls back and forth as part of their injury rehabilitation.\nFortunately, we’ve moved beyond animal skin to a nice gentle leather-bound weighted ball coming in all range of sizes from 2 to 25 pounds! Plus, they’re easy to find.\nMedicine balls can be purchased online, in any sporting goods store and even at some of the general retailers like Target or Walmart.\nIf you are looking for a fun new way to workout, go out and get yourself a medicine ball and try this quick medicine ball workout we’ve put together.\nIt’s a combo of strength and cardio that will get your heart rate up, strengthen your muscles and, best of all, increase your stability and core strength.\nIf you are new to using the ball, go for something moderate: 6, 8 or 10 pound balls are a great place to start for this routine. You will perform each exercise for 1 minute, with a 10-second rest in between.\nTotal-Body Medicine Ball Workout\nWarm-Up 1 minute: Begin by lightly jogging for 30 seconds.
