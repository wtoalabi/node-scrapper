Coughs: Honey\nHoney is a known natural cough suppressant. Studies have shown that taking 2 teaspoons of honey 30 minutes before bed can lessen the severity and frequency of nighttime coughing from allergies or a cold.\n2. Hay Fever: Pine Bark Extract\nPine bark contains a unique combination of bioflavonoids and organic acids, and was used for years by Native Americans to make soothing pine extracts and teas. Studies have shown that taking pine bark extract can naturally reduce the uncomfortable eye and nasal symptoms of hay fever. Look for pine bark extract supplements at your local health foods store.\n3. Sinus Congestion: Spicy Tonic\nThe following Spicy Tonic from Everyday Roots is great to have on hand when dealing with sinus congestion from allergies or a cold. That’s because the ingredients included all act as natural expectorants (helping your body rid itself of phlegm) or decongestants (soothing nasal passages that have become swollen and inflamed.)\nNatural Sinus Congestion Relief Spicy Tonic:\n\nCombine ¼ lemon juice with ¼ cup apple cider vinegar in a pot and bring to a gentle boil.\nStir in 3 tablespoons of raw honey and ¼ teaspoon of cayenne pepper and powdered ginger each.\nStore mixture in a jar in a cool dark place—take 1-2 tablespoons daily as needed. (Shake well before using.)\n\n4. Wheezing: Red Grapes\nRed grapes are among the superfoods that help reduce allergy symptoms because of their high resveratrol content. Resveratrol helps reduce inflammation in the lungs and remove phlegm from airways.\nARTHRITIS\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Osteoarthritis Pain: Capsaicin\nMore than 15 million people over the age of 45 suffer from osteoarthritis, which causes pain and stiffness in the joints. One natural remedy for arthritis pain is capsaicin—the “hot” chemical in chili peppers. Find it over the counter at drugstores and apply topically to skin.\n6. Osteoarthritis Pain: Tart Cherries\nStudies have shown that tart cherries help reduce chronic inflammation which leads to osteoarthritis pain. Munch on tart cherry varieties (like Montmorency or Balaton) or drink a glass of tart cherry juice daily to reduce pain symptoms.\n7. Rheumatoid Arthritis: Diet Heavy in Omega-3’s\nAmong the key anti-inflammatory sources found in food, fatty acids found in fish are one of the greatest. Salmon, tuna, sardines, and mackerel are the best sources of Omega-3 fatty acids and can help reduce the inflammation linked to rheumatoid arthritis.\nCOLD & FLU\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Colds: Thieves Essential Oil\nWe’re big fans of Thieves essential oil, which is a blend of clove, cinnamon, eucalyptus, rosemary, and lemon. This antimicrobial blend works to stop the spread of cold and flu viruses. We like to rub a little on our carotid artery or the bottoms of our feet when we feel a cold coming on to keep us healthy.\n9. Colds: Echinacea\nTaking Echinacea can increase your number of white blood cells, which helps fight infections. You can buy Echinacea extract or Echinacea supplements at your local health foods store to take throughout the duration of your cold.\n10. Colds: Beta Carotene\nBeta-carotene is a powerful antioxidant that boosts immune function—one of our editors swears by upping her intake of beta-carotene foods when she feels a cold coming on! Get a healthy dose of beta-carotene from foods like carrots, butternut squash, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes.\n11. Colds: Eucalyptus Chest Rub\nWe’ve been rubbing Vick’s on our kids chests when they have a chest cold for years—it also can help stop a cough if rubbed on the bottom of the feet. But we’re also fond of an all-natural eucalyptus chest rub from Puremedy that works just as well to open up airways and soothe a sore chest.\n12. Cough: Dark Chocolate\nYep, we’re giving you an excuse to eat some dark chocolate! Research has found that cocoa contains demulcent properties that help quell the urge to cough—so grab a few squares of dark chocolate to suck on or chew when you have a cough that just won’t quit.\n13. Flu: Lemons\nLemons are loaded with Vitamin C and are one of the best foods you can incorporate into your diet to stay healthy. Drink warm water with lemon to boost your immunity or build resistance to a flu or cold.\n14. Healing: Vitamin C\nSpeaking of Vitamin C, whether you’re suffering from the flu, a cold, or other ailments, over 75 years of medical research has conclusively found that Vitamin C has the power activate the body’s “self-healing response.” So yes, it is worth it to take vitamin C supplements and load up on orange juice when you want to get over an illness.\n15. Laryngitis: Slippery Elm\nThe inner bark of the Slippery Elm tree has long been used medicinally and is often used as an at-home treatment for laryngitis. Add some fresh slippery elm to water. It will form into a gel-like substance—swallow the gel several times a day or try slippery elm lozenges instead.\n16. Nasal Congestion: Household Ingredients\nIngredients like fennel, sage, hot mustard and horseradish stimulate the cilia—the little hair-like structures that move mucus through your nasal passages—helping to relieve congestion. Incorporate the ingredients to your meals when trying to relieve a stuffy nose.\n17. Nasal Congestion: Saline Solution\nWhen you’re suffering from a stuffed-up nose, over the counter saline solution may be your best bet. We like the Ocean brand—just follow the instructions and spray the solution in your nasal passages to moisten them and relieve congestion.\n18. Nose Bleeds: Garlic or Vitamin K\nGarlic is high in sulphur, which aids with blood clotting—as does Vitamin K. You can take Vitamin K supplements daily during the winter or whenever you are most susceptible to nose bleeds.\n19. Sore Throat: Garlic Cloves\nSoothe a sore throat with garlic, which contains antiviral compounds that can destroy a flu virus before it becomes a full-blown flu in the body. Chew a raw clove every three hours or, if you can’t handle the taste, cut cloves into pieces and add to a soup or stir-fry recipe. Essential oils can also be a sore throat’s best friend!

Acid Reflex: Aloe Vera\nAloe Vera contains enzymes that help neutralize stomach acid and calm inflammation that may be caused by acid erosion. Pick up Aloe juice at grocery or drugstores and start with an ounce dose, gradually working up to a 2-3 ounce dose. Drink 20 minutes prior to meal to reduce acid reflux.\n21. Constipation: Apple Cider Vinegar\nDilute 2 tablespoons of Apple cider Vinegar in a glass of water and drink for a natural laxative that helps stimulate the bowels.\n22. Constipation: Slippery Elm Tea\nSlippery Elm tea has been used as an herbal remedy since the 19th century because it helps relieve a number of digestive ailments, constipation included. You can purchase teas with slippery elm as a main ingredient or get slippery elm bark powder and combine it with boiling water to make homemade tea.\n23. Gas Pain: Fennel\nDrink fennel tea, incorporate fresh fennel leaves in stews and salads, or simply chew fresh fennel leaves—however you get your fennel, it will help alleviate gas pain and bloating. This is because fennel contains anti-spasmodic, anti-inflammatory properties that relax the stomach.\n24. Heartburn: Marshmallow root\nMarshmallow root has a mucilage (slimy quality) similar to slippery elm which coats the stomach lining and esophagus and soothes heartburn. Marshmallow root can be taken as a capsule, or you can infuse a tablespoon of marshmallow root in two cups of cold water overnight—you’ll end up with a slightly bittersweet-tasting concoction you can drink the next day to soothe your pain.\n25. Heartburn: Pickle Juice\nIt may sound counterintuitive, but a few sips of pickle juice helps balance the pH in your stomach and quickly alleviates heartburn. Take a few sips when you have heartburn or indigestion.\nRelated: 9 Surprising Ways To Use Leftover Pickle Juice\n26. Heartburn:  Elevated Bed\nRaise the head of your bed 4-6 inches so that you prevent the acids in your stomach from flowing up into the esophagus at night. You can stick blocks or books underneath the head of the bed to elevate it.\n27. Heartburn: Pick A Side\nSleeping on your left side has been shown to reduce nighttime heartburn symptoms by keeping the junction between the stomach and esophagus above the level of gastric acid.\n28. Heartburn: Almonds\nAlmonds help neutralize stomach acid; as soon as you experienced heartburn, reach for a small handful to stop the burn.\n29. Intestinal Pain: Reflexology\nWhen intestinal discomfort sets in, take your thumb and forefinger to the outer portion of the middle of the soles of your feet. Firmly massage the area—which reflexology suggests is connected to the colon—for five minutes. Your strokes should direct towards the heel.\n30. Nausea: Peppermints\nEffective in numbing the stomach wall, the cooling menthol in peppermint oil eases stomach pain and relieves nausea. Suck on some peppermints after dinner to ease digestion.\n31. Nausea: Acupressure\nSome people find that pressing the inner parts of both wrists together firmly can reduce feelings of nausea. This area is referred to as the Inner Gate—experts suggest pressing firmly for three minutes to temporarily relieve nausea.\n32. Stomachache: Ginger\nGinger is a commonly used remedy for stomachaches of many kinds.We’re fans of Trader Joe’s gingermints and keep some on-hand for whenever an upset stomach presents itself.\n33. Motion Sickness: Peppermint Essential Oil\nWhether by plane, train, boat or car, motion sickness can occur while traveling and is no fun. Take a whiff or two of peppermint oil before leaving on your journey to calm an upset stomach.\nEYES & EARS\n\n\n\n\n\n34. Dry Eye: Eye Breaks\nIn today’s age of constant screen time, most cases of dry eye are caused by a lack of “rest” time for your eyes away from screens. Take a break from screens every 20 minutes to focus on objects in different planes at different distances.\n35. Styes: Steam\nBoil water over the stove or with a teacup, and pour into a mug. Hold the mug close to the affected eye, being careful not to touch the skin or burn yourself but letting the steam rise to the stye. Repeat multiple times per day to bring the stye to a head.\n36. Eyelash Hair Loss: Aloe Vera\nAloe vera can help nourish your lashes and help them grow more quickly. Take an old mascara wand and dip it in some aloe vera gel. Run the wand through your lashes before bed, rinse off with warm water the next morning.\n37. Earache: Hot Water Bottle\nFor ear pain, take a hot water bottle and wrap it in a towel. Hold it against the affected ear for five minutes at a time to reduce pain.\n38. Ringing In The Ears: Gingko Biloba\nTinnitus, or ringing in the ears, can be caused by anything from poor circulation to infection. Gingko biloba is an herbal remedy that can be taken as a supplement; it boosts circulation and has been shown to reduce tinnitus symptoms.\nFEET\n\n\n\n\n\n39. Athlete’s Foot: Tea Tree Oil\nTea tree oil is a natural antiseptic and works as an effective anti-fungal when fighting infections like athlete’s foot. Add five drops of Tea Tree Oil to a tablespoon of olive oil and apply to the foot twice a day for several days.\n40. Corns: Brewer’s Yeast and Lemon Juice\nTake a teaspoon of brewer’s yeast and add a drop or two of lemon juice. Apply this mixture to the corn using a cotton pad, and bind it in place. Leave the cotton ball in place overnight, and remove the next morning. Repeat until the corn is gone.\n41.

Foot Pain: Vinegar\nVinegar treatments can help lessen foot pain caused by sprains because they reduce inflammation. Fill a tub with hot water and add two tablespoons of vinegar and some Epsom salts. Soak your feet in the mixture for about 20 minutes.\nFEMININE HEALTH\n\n\n\n\n\n43. Hot Flashes: Ground Flaxseed\nPreliminary studies have found that women halved the frequency of their hot flashes by incorporating two tablespoons of ground flaxseed into their diet per day. Flaxseed contains lignans, which are estrogen-like compounds thought to help fluctuating hormonal levels in the body. You can sprinkle flaxseeds on yogurt, toss them in salads, or add them to your granola and oatmeal.\n44. Menstrual Cramps: Mustard or Pickle Juice\nBoth of these household condiments contain vinegar, which contains acetic acid. Acetic acid makes acetylcholine, which helps our muscles work—the more acetylcholine you have, the more pain-free your muscles will function.\n45. Menstrual Cramps: Tonic water\nSip on tonic water during the days leading up to your period to alleviate cramps. Tonic water contains quinine, which is a natural muscle relaxant.\n46. Menstrual cramps: Raspberry Red Tea\nRaspberry tea is made from raspberry leaves, which have been used for centuries to relieve menstrual cramps and have even been used during pregnancy to ease discomfort.\n47. PMS: Apple Cider Vinegar\nA teaspoon of apple cider vinegar three times a day before meals can help relieve some of the symptoms of PMS. You can dilute it in a little water if the taste is too unpleasant.\n48. Thyroid Imbalance: Selenium\nSelenium deficiency can cause thyroid problems, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

Natural sources of selenium can be found in Brazil nuts, tuna, oysters, onions, garlic, and more.\n49.

Bananas are rich in potassium and vitamin B6, both of which prevent water retention and bloating. \nHAIR & NAILS\n\n\n\n\n\n51.

Mix 5-7 drops of eucalyptus oil with your shampoo for itchy scalp relief.\n54. Nail fungus: White Vinegar\nVinegar helps restore the skin’s pH balance—and a pH imbalance is usually to blame for nail fungus. Mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a bowl and use a cotton swab to apply a small amount to affected nail twice a day to treat nail fungus.\n55. Brittle nails: Petroleum Jelly\nIf dry winter air or one-too-many-gel-manicures made your nails turn brittle, reach for some Vaseline. Applying petroleum jelly to your nails and covering with cotton gloves help them retain moisture.\nMENTAL HEALTH\n\n\n\n\n\n56. Anxiety: Lavender\nLavender has been known to produce a calming, slightly sedative effect, and has been used as a holistic remedy for nervousness or anxiety for many years.

Depressed Mood: Vitamin B\nVitamin B-12 helps produce brain chemicals that affect our mood, and low levels of B-12 may be linked to depression, according to the Mayo Clinic. The best way to get enough B-12 is to eat a healthy diet that contains things like lean protein, fish, and eggs—but a B-12 supplement may be beneficial for those suffering from depression.\n58. Depressed Mood: Rosemary Tea\nStudies have shown that consuming rosemary tea has a slight anti-depressant effect on one’s mood. Even taking a whiff of rosemary has been shown to reduce cortisol (stress) levels in the body, and the herb has been used for centuries as a natural mood balancer.\n59. Panic Attacks: 4-7-8 Breath\nThe 4-7-8 Breath, championed by Dr. Weill, has been said to reduce feelings of panic and anxiety.

Chew on them after dinner to prevent bad breath.\n62. Bad Breath: Parsley\nA sprig of parsley on your plate does more than garnish your meal—munching on some parsley after you eat can also help freshen your breath.\n63. Canker Sores:  Warm Salt Water\nGargle with warm salt water a few times throughout the day to relieve pain caused by canker sores.\n64. Canker sores: Slippery Elm Lozenges\nSuck on slippery elm lozenges or take slippery elm capsules, found at your local health foods store. Slippery elm helps soothe the tissue inside the mouth.\n65. Hiccups: A Spoonful of Sugar\nFor a bad case of the hiccups, turn to this sweet solution. Take a teaspoon of sugar and, using your tongue, massage it around the roof of your mouth for several seconds, as the sugar begins to melt. Sugar is usually enough to stimulate the vagus nerve, essentially “distracting” your body enough to stop hiccupping.\n66.

Studies show that a daily dose of Devil’s claw reduces back pain more than placebo pills.\n71. Back Pain: White Willow Bark\nThe use of willow bark dates back to 400 BC, when people were given the bark to chew on to reduce inflammation. The bark contains salicin, which is a chemical similar to aspirin. White willow bark has been shown to reduce pain more slowly than aspirin, but its pain-relief may actually last longer once it sets in. You can find white willow bark supplements at your local health foods store.\n72. Headaches:  Cayenne Pepper\nThe capsaicin found in cayenne pepper helps reduce pain and inflammation while also stimulating circulation. You can mix cayenne powder with a starchy food and ingest when you have a migraine or throbbing headache.\n73. Headaches: Peppermint\nDating back to the physicians of ancient Greece, peppermint has been one of the most commonly utilized natural headache treatments. Either sip peppermint tea, apply peppermint oil mixed with a carrier oil to your forehead, or crumple a clean mint life and insert it into one nostril, removing after two minutes.\n74. Headaches: Inversion Yoga Poses\nInversion yoga poses are poses where your head is lower than your heart or legs—like downward facing dog or legs up the wall pose. Inversions stimulate circulation in the head and can help alleviate tension headaches.\nRelated: How To Relieve Headaches With Yoga\n75. Joint Pain: Fish Oil\nTwo types of omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are EPA and DHA, both of which can reduce inflammation and joint pain. Take fish oil pills daily for pain management.\n76.

Don’t just drink when you’re thirsty; continuously drink water throughout the day, making sure to get at least 64 ounces per day.\n77. Muscle Cramps: Magnesium and Potassium\nTry adding more veggies, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and berries that have plenty of magnesium or potassium into your diet.

Migraines: Acupuncture\nTraditional Chinese medicine has used acupuncture to treat migraines for thousands of years by inserting fine needles into specific points on the body in order to reduce head tension.\n79.

A cup of coffee or caffeinated tea can sometimes help relieve headache pain.\nSKIN\n\n\n\n\n\n80. Acne: Tea Tree Oil\nWhiteheads often respond well to tea tree oil—which has antimicrobial properties to help keep your skin clean and pimple-free. Choose a topical treatment consisting of at least 5 percent tea tree oil.\n81. Age Spots: Castor oil\nCaster oil is a common vegetable oil that has been used for its medicinal purposes across Africa, India, and the Mediterranean for centuries.

Rub olive oil or coconut oil into the cellulite first, and then massage some of the coffee/sugar mixture into the same area.\n86. Dry Patches of Skin: Coconut Oil\nCoconut oil is one of the best natural remedies for dry skin—the saturated fats it contains help the skin stay moisturized, smooth, and even-toned.\n87. Eczema: Oat Bath\nAn oatmeal bath has been shown to help reduce itchy skin caused by eczema or other skin conditions. To create, fill a dry sock with whole oats. Close the open end with a rubber band and add the sock into a warm bath—soak for 20 minutes.\n88.

Add 1-2 drops of this essential oil to a carrier oil (like coconut oil) and slather on skin to prevent stretch marks.\n93. Warts: Carrots\nCarrots stimulate skin renewal and strengthen the immune system because of their high Vitamin A and Vitamin C content. Finely grate a small carrot and combine with a teaspoon of olive oil. Apply the mixture to warts once a day.\n94. Warts: Duct Tape\nOddly enough, studies have proven duct tape can be just as effective as cryotherapy when fighting warts. The duct tape is believed to irritate the area so the patient’s immune system is triggered and forced to react. Place duct tape on affected area and leave on for six days, then take off and soak the skin in water and exfoliate with a pumice stone. After 12 hours without the duct tape on, replace with new duct tape and continue this cycle until wart disappears.\nSLEEP ISSUES\n\n\n\n\n\n95. Fatigue: Rosemary Oil\nThis essential oil has many benefits, but one of our favorites? Helping us fight afternoon fatigue. Rosemary oil contains a high amount of cineole, an oxide that is associated with increasing cerebral blood flow, which reduces feelings of fatigue. Take a whiff, combine a few drops with a carrier oil (like coconut oil) and apply as a lotion, or get a rosemary diffuser for your desk to keep you alert and focused.\n96. Fatigue: Vitamin D\nPersistent fatigue can be a symptom of vitamin D deficiency. If you’re getting adequate sleep but still feel consistently tired, try taking a Vitamin D supplement—especially if you live in a climate where you don’t get plentiful sunshine.\n97.

Although you can get magnesium from certain foods (like almonds, bananas, or leafy greens) many people are magnesium deficient, so taking a magnesium supplement before bed may be necessary.\n99. Insomnia: Sleepytime Tea\nNothing helps you relax like a nightly cup of tea. Try Celestial Seasoning’s Sleepytime Tea, blended with a mixture of calming chamomile, spearmint, and lemongrass—the combination is ultra-soothing and sweet with a little honey.\n100. Problems Staying Asleep: Tart Cherry Juice\nResearch shows that drinking tart cherry juice twice a day can help you sleep almost an hour and a half more per night because of its high melatonin content.
