"We always advocate for eating your veggies here at Get Healthy U; they’re low calorie, full of vitamins and are incredibly versatile in recipes! And today, we want to highlight one of the most amazing vegetables and a team favorite: Beets! Now, when you hear me say “beet”, you may think of the full tub of watery, pinkish slices at the salad bar no one touches, but that is a very sad picture for this amazing vegetable! In fact, beets are one of the most delicious ingredients you can add to salads, smoothies, sandwiches and more! So why are we so obsessed with this powerful superfood? Not to mention the taste, which we’d describe to be sweet and earthy, the nutritional benefits are incredibly expansive. Oftentimes, the saturation of color in a vegetable means that it’s incredibly nutrient rich. This holds true for beets. Beets are known for their bright red color (present from their betacyanin pigment), but there are also golden varieties (present from their betaxanthin pigment). Whether eaten whole or juiced, here are 9 of their amazing benefits!\n\n\n\nThey naturally detoxify.\n\n\nBeets naturally detoxify the body due to a group phytonutrients called betalains. This allows them to remove unwanted toxins, purify your blood, skin, kidneys and liver.\nRelated: 13 Surprising Benefits of Cinnamon\n\n\nThey are nutrient-rich and low calorie.\n\n\nBeets are loaded with many nutrients including but not limited to potassium—442 milligrams per cup to be exact— folate (or vitamin B9), manganese, magnesium and vitamin C while still being low in calories—only 37 per half cup.\n\n\nThey lower blood pressure. \n\n\nBeets naturally contain nitrates which the body turns into a gas known as nitric oxide. Nitric oxide then prevents blood from thickening and clotting as well as relaxing and dilating your blood vessels, thus lowering blood pressure.\n\n\nThey fight heart disease.\n\n\nBeets are also touted to be able to fight heart disease as they are the highest plant based source of betaine which lower C-reactive protein levels often linked to heart disease.\n\n\nThey contain cancer-fighting properties. \n\n\nThe same phytonutrients responsible for the color of beets are also the same ones we can look to for their anti-cancer properties. Beets can increase oxygen in the blood by 400 percent and rid the body of toxins which helps to kill cancer cells.\n\n\nThey increase exercise endurance. \n\n\nBecause of the presence of betacyanin, beet have actually been proven to increase an indiviual’s exercise endurance. So before you head to gym, think about incorporating beets into your morning meal and you may just be able to push yourself harder and up to 16 percent longer.\n\n\nThey reduce inflammation. \n\n\nBeets contain several compounds that are shown to reduce inflammation in the body including betaine, isobetain and vulgaxanthin.\n\n\nThey are good for “that time of month”.\n\n\nBecause beets contain iron, they are particularly good for women as it can help replenish iron lost during their menstrual cycle.\n\n\nThey reduce birth defects.\n\n\nBeets are a great choice for pregnant women as eating beets can reduce the risk of birth defects in your baby due to the presence of folic acid used in the development of a baby’s spinal column.\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to try working beets into your diet?
