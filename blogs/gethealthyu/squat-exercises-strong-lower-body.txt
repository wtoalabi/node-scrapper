"Squats. It seems they show up in nearly every workout. You might think you escape them when you step away from traditional strength training, but no such luck. \nThey show up in the bob and weave of kickboxing, or come disguised as a plié during barre class. Even those sweet, gentle yoga instructors have tried to trick us with something they call the “chair pose”.  \nYep, squats keep showing up, which means they must be good. So what makes the squat such a great move?\nThe Benefits of Squats\n\n\n\n\n\nStrengthen Legs\nLet’s start with the obvious: squats tone and shape your legs beautifully. Squats strengthen all the muscles in your legs including your quadriceps, hamstrings and calves. \nDepending on the way you turn your toes, you can also focus more on inner thighs or outer thighs. If you’re looking for beautiful, strong legs, turn to squats on a regular basis! \nTighten Your Tush\nTime to tighten and lift that rear end? What’s better than a traditional squat. \nPerformed with proper form, a squat should leave your glutes sore the next day. Is there a better feeling than a sore backside after a hard workout? Squats will do it.\nStronger Core and Low Back\nYour abs, hips and low back are involved in a good squat too. You engage all the core muscles for nearly any squat variation you do, but especially if you are holding extra weight. \nAll of the core muscles pull in to keep your posture in the proper place during your squat and help you maintain good stability. \nBuild Muscle\nSquats build lower body muscles, which are the larger muscles in your body. \nBy building muscle anywhere in your body you increase your metabolism, but when you build the larger muscles you increase your metabolism even more.\nLose Fat\nIncreasing your muscle mass increases your metabolism. When you increase your metabolism you are more efficient at burning fat on your body all the time, not just during a workout. \nSquats burn calories during the exercise, but they also help you lose fat by burning more calories throughout the entire day.\nAs you can see, there are many reasons to do squats. This basic squat is the best place to start. Learn it well and concentrate on proper form and a deep range of motion. \nRelated: 10 Lower Body Exercises To Combat Knee Pain\nOnce you have learned the basic squat and it feels comfortable to you, it’s time to mix it up! Taking new variations on squats can add new dimensions and benefits while still keeping the basic benefits intact. \nFor example, if you want more inner thigh work, a plié squat is a great choice. By turning your legs open (external rotation), the inner thigh muscles are activated and turned on for more help. \nIf your focus is solely on shaping your butt, then a pistol squat or single leg squat is a great variety to mix into your workout. \nWant to burn extra fat and calories? Jump squats are your new friend. \nOr maybe you’re on a quest for stronger abs. If so, a front squat or goblet squat would be a great choice. \nThere are more squat variations than you can imagine so stay creative and be willing to change your position.\n1.
