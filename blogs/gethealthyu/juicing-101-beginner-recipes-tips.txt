"I know many of us are committed to eating better.\nOne nutrition trend I am a big fan of is juicing! Don’t worry – juicing for beginners can be fun and uncomplicated, just keep reading.\nI get tons of questions about different cleanses and fasts, but my approach to nutrition is simple: I try to eat from a plant, tree, or animal at every meal. Fruits and vegetables are a non-negotiable for me. I avoid highly processed or pre-prepared foods as much as possible. I avoid quick fix detoxes, radical cleanses or empty promises from companies trying to cash in because I believe that if you eat well, your body will take care of itself.\nJuicing has become quite popular in the last 10 years popping up in local strip malls, cafes and gyms because, simply, it makes people feel good.\nAnd while I don’t recommend a juicing meal plan necessarily, drinking fresh juice alongside healthy eating habits is an easy way to ensure you are getting your recommended servings of fruits and vegetables. Oh, and it tastes great!\nYes, juicing is delicious, and you may be surprised as to how easily you too will become obsessed with this healthy habit. I personally add fresh juice to my diet and do not advocate juice cleanses or fasts that eliminate whole foods.\nBut, juicing may be the quickest way to add nutrients to your body and feel totally energized.\nI put together this quick guide to juicing for beginners, including my nine favorite juicing recipes to share with you along with a few juicing tips to get you started!\n\nRelated: The Kale Kraze: 5 Ways To Eat Kale\nYou will need a juicer, so what juicer is right for you?\nThe Best Juicers For Every Budget\nA juicer can range from $60 to over $2,000! I know my first car wasn’t even $2,000, but just saying there is a wide range out there.\nI know many sites offer refurbished juicers as well, so that is an option if you don’t want to buy new. Here are a few options you may want to look at:\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSO when it comes to affordable juicers, this is the best selling juicer on Amazon. And if you are like me, I am convinced when there are over 2000 good reviews! I did order this one for my mother-in-law a few years back and she still uses it and likes it!!\n$$\n\n\n\n\nA middle of the road option is the Breville Juice Fountain Plus at 850 watts that retails for around $150. Breville is probably the best-known name in juicers and stands for quality.\n$$$\n\n\n\n\n\nA little more pricey is the Breville Juice Fountain Elite with 1,000 watts of rocket-like power. This is a commercial grade juicer, so if you plan to juice a ton, this is the juicer for you. It retails for $299 so it’s pricey. This is the juicer I bought 15 years ago and although it wasn’t cheap, it may be one of the best investments I have ever made.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBeginner Juicing Tips\n\n\nRead Your Manual\nTypically, I’m not a huge fan of “reading directions” and most often just figure appliances out on my own. Trust me, you should really read the manual in this case. My juicer comes with a low and high setting that I can adjust for different vegetables. My manual has a list of those veggies and what speed they should be juiced at for optimal results. Also, if you get a big daddy juicer like I have, you really need to make sure all the pieces are together correctly so you don’t accidentally juice a finger.\n\nBalance Fruit With Veggies\nTry to use the 80/20 rule for juicing. Try to think 80% veggies and 20% fruit for most of your juices to keep sugar content low. You will also want to remove any skins that are inedible (such as mango skin and citrus peels), large seeds or pits and wash all of your produce well.\n\nDrink Right Away\nThe point of juicing is to enjoy the fresh juice right away. Fresh juice will lose nutrients as it oxidizes, so plan to drink your juice immediately. If you make extra or can’t drink it all at once, store your juice in an airtight container like a thermos or mason jar, filling to the top and making sure it’s sealed. Make sure to refrigerate it ASAP. Fresh juice will keep for up to 24 hours, but I try to drink mine in under 12. I typically drink my juice for breakfast or as an afternoon pick-me-up. Drinking juice on an empty stomach is best as those nutrients are absorbed right away and don’t have to fight with other foods your body is trying to digest at the same time.\n\nHave Fun!\nI have tried tons of juice recipes and then made my own adaptations based on my taste. Try new fruits and vegetables and get your friends and family involved. Don’t be afraid to experiment with cooky concoctions. Who knows? Maybe beet and broccoli is the next big thing!\n\nRelated: Juicing vs. Blending: Which Is Better For You?\nJuicing Recipes For Beginners\nNow let’s get started.

While juicing is a great daily habit, there’s no need to overdo it. Juicing should never replace a meal because a juice – although very healthy – does not have all the essential nutrition you need for a full meal. Most juicing guidelines recommend between 8 oz to 16 oz of juice per day. It’s important to listen to your body, your own hunger cues, and follow what makes sense for your lifestyle.\nCan you lose weight by just juicing?\nAlthough people often think juicing is a weight loss strategy, it really isn’t. Adding a glass of fresh-squeezed juice to your day is a great way to increase nutrients in your body. But a glass of juice a day isn’t about losing weight, it’s about nutritional supplementation.\nJuice cleanses where only juice is consumed for a period of days is a potentially dangerous idea. Most juice cleanses will have you only consuming 600-1000 calories a day which is considered a very restrictive amount. And depending on how long you do it, you could be missing out on certain nutrients needed for your body to function.\nIf you have watched the documentary, Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead, it is no doubt eye-opening and interesting. Juicing has its place in a healthy diet. But be aware that Juicing Joe had a doctor’s supervision and advice throughout the film. I am a believer in juicing but it’s not a weight-loss strategy that is easy to execute on your own.\nThis juicing for beginners guide to juicing is just a start, we recommend having fun with this! Here is to fresh juice, more energy and better health!\n\nREAD THIS NEXT: 31 Recipes & Ideas To Use Your Summer Produce Surplus"
