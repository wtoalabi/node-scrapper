"Jumping around as a kid was fun. Jumping around as an adult helps you get fit. We call this plyometric training or, “jump training.” Plyometrics use explosive movements to build strength and to condition the muscles and heart. The exercises themselves are forms of jumping. In essence, you perform an explosive move where your feet leave the ground and each time you land, the muscles get a stretch—allowing you to jump with even more power the next time.\nAt one time, plyometrics were primarily used by athletes to improve power for their sport, but now they are definitely part of the fabric of the fitness world! Fitness professionals and enthusiasts everywhere use plyometrics as either a stand-alone workout or in parts of other workout programs. Plyometrics boost muscle power, strength, balance and agility—and help you burn calories.\nHow Often Should I Do Plyometrics?\nPlyometrics are a form of strength training so you don’t want to do them every day. Your muscles will need a good 48-hour break in between sessions. If you’re not active now, you may need to start working on your basic fitness first and later have a pro show you how to do the moves properly to ensure effectiveness and avoid injury.\nCan I Modify with Low Impact?\nOf course you can modify any high impact activity to make it low impact. However, in this case ,by taking away the jumping motions you are essentially taking away the definition of a plyometric. In other words, you might be doing a great exercise, but it won’t be a plyometric workout. That being said, the workout below can be adjusted to meet your needs.\nAre Plyometrics Primarily Muscle or Cardio?\nBoth! Plyometrics are muscle-focused and you are going to gain strength. But plyometrics are also great way to experience anaerobic interval training. Anaerobic intervals increase your cardiovascular capacity and will get you into shape quickly!\nRelated: 4 Best Ways To Burn Mega Calories\nI’m Ready!
