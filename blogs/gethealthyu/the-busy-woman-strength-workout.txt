"Tell me if this sounds familiar: some days, you’re lucky if you find two minutes to yourself, let alone enough time to change clothes, drive to the gym, and get a workout in. If so, you’re not alone. Between the demands of work, family, and life’s other responsibilities, we all have some points in our lives when finding “me” time seems damn near impossible, let alone the time to workout. If this sounds like you, and you know you should workout and strength train but can’t find the time, we’re here to help.  You only need seven spare minutes—yep, seven—for this strength training workout that will tone your body and get you sweating.\nThis total-body workout doesn’t require any fancy equipment other than a simple pair of dumbbells and a little room to move.
