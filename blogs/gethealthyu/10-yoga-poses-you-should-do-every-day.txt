"No matter where you find yourself on your fitness journey, there is one thing we all have in common: the need to stretch. Why? Well, it turns out there are many reasons.\nBenefits of Daily Yoga\nThere are so many reasons to add yoga to your daily routine, even if it’s just a five-minute flow:\n1. Helps Stiffness and Sore Muscles\nThe most obvious benefit of stretching is to relieve stiff, sore muscles. Whether you are hurting from a hard workout or stiff from being sedentary, stretching alleviates muscle pain. And it’s a more natural and inexpensive solution than popping Advil or Tylenol—both of which can be hard on your body over time. Stretching after workouts helps prevent your muscles from becoming stiff and sore the next day, so you can be ready to get back at it again tomorrow.\n2. Increases Range of Motion\nEverything in our bodies is connected: muscles, bones, and joints included. If the muscles around the joint aren’t flexible, it’s difficult to move efficiently. In other words, muscle stiffness can prevent you from doing full range of motion exercises, cause injury, and worst of all keep you from progressing with your fitness goals. Even those who DON’T exercise regularly will find that skipping stretching limits the ability to take full strides when you walk, reach for things, or move with a complete range of motion. Skip stretching and you’ll eventually have that familiar “grandpa shuffle.”\nRelated: The Beginner’s Guide To Yoga \n3. Relieves Stress\nDon’t underestimate the damage stress can have on both your mental and physical health. A brief stretch break that utilizes deep breathing can provide a respite during the day to find clarity and slow down your breath.\nThe bottom line is this: maintaining flexibility is the key to feeling good, preventing injury, moving well and continuing to enjoy a healthy, active lifestyle well into your second half of life. And while you probably know that yoga provides the flexibility benefits that everyone desires, you may not have the time or the desire to get into a regular yoga practice. But truthfully, if you only do a handful of poses each day, you’ll start to see the difference in how your body looks and feels.
