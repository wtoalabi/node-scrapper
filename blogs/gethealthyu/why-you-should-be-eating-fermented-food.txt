"If you follow health food trends, then this isn’t the first time you’ve heard of fermented foods. With more and more research uncovering the necessity of gut health, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that the food we eat has a huge impact on our overall wellbeing.\nYet despite the sudden exposure of naturally fermented foods, they’ve actually been around for thousands of years being used for their health-promoting properties.\nTo understand how you can take advantage of fermented foods in your diet, it’s important to understand the process and the foods most beneficial in uncovering the healing powers fermented foods have on the body.\nWhat Are Fermented Foods?\n\n\n\n\n \nFermented foods, or “live” foods, are the result of foods that have undergone the process of lactofermentation, in which lactic acid is created as a result of natural bacteria feeding on the food’s sugar and starch.\nDuring this process, advantageous enzymes, b-vitamins, Omega-3 fatty acids and many types of probiotics are produced due to the preservation of the food and its nutrients. The digestive system responds well to fermented foods because of its incredibly healthful qualities.\nRelated: What is Kombucha? (And Why Is It Good For You?)\nWhy Have They Dissipated From Our Diets?\nThough cultures around the world have been incorporating fermented foods into their daily diets for quite some time—think sauerkraut in Germany and kimchi in Korea—the desire for beneficial probiotics and enzymes in the typical diet has decreased globally in the last few decades as a result of the popular western diet, which includes pasteurized dairy milk and yogurt instead of raw, and vinegar-based vegetables like pickles instead of fermented ones.\nIn short, we are settling for a “dead-on-arrival” food reservoir that no longer provides us with one of the most wonderful parts of food: live bacteria our gut needs for optimum health.\nWhat Are The Benefits of Fermented Foods?\n\n\n\n\n\nThey’re Sustainable\nOne of the best things about fermentation is that it is very efficient, requiring little energy in the process, while also boosting foods’ shelf life and lessening the need to be preserved in the refrigerator.\nThey Fight Diseases By Improving Gut Health\nYour gut is a powerful system, making up nearly 80 percent of your immune system. So when you treat it poorly with bad bacteria, you’re only increasing your chances of harming your short and long-term health.\nHowever, fermented foods, complete with good bacteria work to keep nasty sicknesses and diseases at bay.\nThey’re Cost-Effective\nWhile many people associate eating healthy with overspending, that is not always the case, especially when it comes to fermented foods.\nFermented foods have the ability to last for months when done at home, and even longer if bought from the store. Furthermore, a little goes a long way, as they have 100 times more probiotics than a supplement offers.\nThey’re Alive With Healthy Goodness\nUnlike “dead” foods, fermented foods immediately work to balance out your gut bacteria and stomach acids by giving off enzymes that help your digestive system to both absorb more nutrients as well as extract them.\nYou’ll benefit with a balanced gut, where inflammation, constipation, acid reflux and other digestive issues are slim to none.\nThey’re a Natural Detoxifier\nSkip the latest detox fad and instead reach for fermented foods when you’ll looking to clear out and re-boot your system.\nThe good bacteria in fermented foods are able to grab onto toxins in your body such as mercury, aluminum, lead and more and rid them from your body.\nThey Can Clear Up Acne\nAs your body gets rids of toxins, your skin can also be affected in a beneficial way.\nThey Can Help Promote Weight Loss\nDue to the their ability to detoxify, reduce inflammation and increase good gut flora, fermented foods can also be used to lose weight. In addition, they can also lessen sugar and processed food cravings.\nThey Balance The Bodies’ pH Level\nMany of us consume an over-abundance of acidic foods, thus lowering our body’s pH level. Fermented foods, on the other hand, are alkaline forming in the body and thus can restore your pH to normal levels.\nThe Difference Between Pickled & Fermented\nOften, when people start to think about fermented foods, there is an overlap in their mind with pickled foods.\nSo what’s the difference?\nWell, to start pickled food are not necessarily fermented and fermented foods are not necessarily pickled. Pickled foods are made often with vinegar or another acidic ingredient and involve the use of heat.\nFermented foods don’t need to addition of acid, as the fermenting occurs as a result of the food’s natural sugars and naturally present bacteria. Pickling does extend the shelf life of foods, but it does result in the same probiotic and enzymatic makeup that fermented foods do.\nHow To Get More Fermented Foods Into Your Diet\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s one thing to learn about healthy habits, but to execute them can often feel like an overwhelming process we just don’t have time or energy for.
