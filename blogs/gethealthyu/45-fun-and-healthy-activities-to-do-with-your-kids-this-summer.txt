Go to the farmer’s market.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best way kids learn healthy habits is by watching your healthy habits.

When you get home you can make healthy snacks or let them help you prepare a healthy dinner with the items you just purchased.\n2. Make smoothies. \nLittle ones find it fascinating to blend things up. Let them help you put fruit, almond milk and veggies into your smoothie maker or blender.\nI’ve got tons of smoothie recipes your kids will enjoy. Let them see that veggies are even yummy to drink. You could dare your kids to drink something green!\nBuy some reusable color straws and your smoothies are guaranteed to please.\n3. Take a day trip. \nMixing up the routine prevents boredom. Head to a neighboring town and try something new.\nTake a dip in a lake, head out for a hike on a new trail or let your kids enjoy an all-new playground.\nLet your kids appreciate a little change of scenery and schedule.\n4. Go to the gym. \nDoes your gym have childcare?

Plant a garden.\n\n\n\n\n\nHerbs, veggies or flowers? Pick your favorite and dig in the dirt with your kids to let them see that they can grow things with their two little hands.\nThen you can show them how to make good use of what you grow.\nYou can even get them their own gardening tools for some pride of ownership!\n6. Cook together. \nNothing is better than making something healthy for your kids and watching them eat it up, sans whining.\nTry a recipe I love for healthier macaroni and cheese or experiment with a healthier dinner recipe.\n7. Go to the playground. \nSwings, slides, sandboxes and tunnels are easy breezy active fun for your kids. While you keep one eye on the kiddos, you can do your own playground workout.\n8. Do a penny hike. \nThis may sound silly, but when I was a little kid, my mom used to take us on penny hikes.  Back in the day when a penny was worth something, we would flip the penny at each corner; heads we went right, tales we went left.\nEach time the walk would be different. My siblings and I loved penny hikes and I’m sure it was a way for my mom to get outside and stay sane. Try a penny hike with your little ones.\n9. Go swimming\n\n\n\n\n\nMember at a pool club? Own a pool? Buy some of those colorful noodles and make a splash this summer by having regular swim time with the kids.\nPractice different swim strokes or floats or just see who can make the biggest splash.\n10. Create your own race. \nReady, set, go is all it takes if you have toddlers.

Let your kids put on a show. \nMagic shows, puppet shows, dances, or jokes–kids of all ages love to entertain their parents with silly shows.\n15. Let your kids have unstructured time.\nWhen kiddos entertain themselves, they learn to daydream, be independent, and creative.\nPlus, we all could benefit from remembering that not every minute of the day needs to be scheduled.\nLook at you nurturing mindfulness at a young age.\n16.
