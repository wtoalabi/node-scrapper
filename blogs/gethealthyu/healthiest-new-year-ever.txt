Did you follow through or did you completely forget about them come March?\nEither way, this year can be bigger, better, and most importantly, healthier than last year.\nSince I get messages every day asking how to finally ditch those unwanted pounds and get in shape, I’ve rounded up 5 of my top tips on the most important things to start the year on a healthy foot.\nHere’s to your healthiest and happiest year ever!\n1. Be Realistic About Your Goals\nWeight loss and healthy lifestyle changes take time. It’s not going to happen all at once, easily or without you working your butt off (figuratively and literally!).\nWrite yourself a note or commit right now that even when you aren’t seeing the results you want as quickly as you want, you will stay consistent.\nConsistency is the ultimate key and so many of us call it quits before we give ourselves the chance to make a difference.\nIf it helps, toss that scale into a back closet and only pull it out once a week or even once a month. This might sound counterintuitive, but when people are fixated on those three numbers and how those numbers report daily, self-image can take a rollercoaster ride.\nInstead, find other markers of “success.” For instance, were you able to workout five minutes longer today? Are you clothes fitting a little better? Did you say “no” to an indulgence today?\nBe proud of those moments and know that even if you’re not seeing outward change yet, you’re still doing a good thing for your body.\n2. Implement One to Two Healthy Dietary Changes\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking changes to your diet is a huge part of healthy living and weight loss. But sometimes we bite off more than we can chew.\nMy recommendation? Choose just a couple things to focus on when it comes to nutritional changes.\nRather than jumping into a crazy diet that throws off your entire routine (which I don’t recommend for a number of reasons), start to implement just one or two changes and then add in more once you’ve developed those habits.\nA couple ideas:\n\nCut out soda\nMake 1-2 more home cooked meals each week\nAdd 2 more servings of fruit each day\nAdd 2 more servings of vegetables each day\nLower your sugar intake\nIncrease your daily fiber intake\n\nSpeaking of fiber… most people don’t realize how crucial fiber is when it comes to weight loss.\nMillions of Americans feel sluggish, weighed down, and “blah” because of their digestive system. Fiber is a plant-based nutrient often referred to as “roughage” or “bulk” that helps efficiently move food through the body. Fiber only comes from plant-based foods, and unfortunately, most Americans don’t eat nearly enough fiber every day!\nThat is why I’m so excited to partner with Metamucil and take the Metamucil Two-Week Challenge as part of my healthy resolutions in 2019! Metamucil is a daily supplement that contains 100% natural psyllium fiber, a soluble fiber that works with your digestive system to help trap and remove the waste that weights you down.\nThe Metamucil Two-Week Challenge asks people to add one small step to their daily routine for two weeks to promote regularity*.\nIf you’re currently among the 95% of Americans who don’t get enough fiber in their diet, join my in this challenge!\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Get Your Body Moving \n\nIf you’re just getting started with a renewed commitment to healthy living, it can start with something as simple as ten minutes.  \nIf you’ve ever wondered if 10 minutes works, try this Low Impact Circuit Workout I created for you and let me know how you feel.  I bet it will get your heart pumping, muscles moving and give you some extra energy. It’s low impact on the joints (no jumping) so great for those of you looking for something kinder to the body but still a great workout.  \nExercise doesn’t have to be an hour long session. Even breaking it into ten minute increments will help you on your journey to a healthier 2019.  \n4. Focus on Sleep \nI know you’ve heard it before: “strive for seven or eight hours of sleep each night.” \nAnd while this may seem unrealistic for you, here’s a fact: in a study from the University of Pennsylvania, subjects who slept four and a half hours a night for one week felt more stressed, angry, sad, and mentally exhausted compared to their normal sleep patterns. \nPrioritizing sleep when you can will result in a better mood and also help you make healthier choices when it come to food. \nWhy? When you’re sleep-deprived, two hormones in your body—leptin and ghrelin—can get thrown out of whack which affects how satiated you feel and your appetite throughout the day. \nSo no, you’re not just imagining things when you feel like being sleepy makes you feel hungrier and overeat throughout the day—it really does!\nAnd since a solid and consistent sleep schedule can be the difference between an energy-filled one and dreary one, stress the importance of seven to eight hours a night.\n5. Drink More Water \nWater is critical to keeping your body functioning at its highest level. Plus, if weight loss is your goal, water is going to be your new best friend. \nStaying hydrated helps you stay energized and healthy; plus it keeps you from over-eating when your body is really just thirsty. \nWhen your body is dehydrated, all sorts of things from mental fogginess to dizziness to fatigue can set in.\nNo matter what healthy things you’re adding to your water (like Metamucil!), aim for at least 64 ounces of water throughout the day. \nNot sure how? Try out our favorite hack to drink more water each day – it really works!!\n*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
