"So you’re having a baby. First things first – congratulations! Now, let’s talk about your health and fitness. Truth be told, you have every right to spend the next few months relaxing and preparing for the joy and exhaustion ahead. But the other truth you might want to know is this – you will want to keep moving! My mother’s generation was told to rest and stay still to give the baby every advantage of health and well-being. Fortunately, medical science has learned that the baby and mom will BOTH benefit when the mom continues to exercise and move her body. Perhaps the most gentle and beneficial ways to do this is with yoga! Yes – pregnant women can be yogis. Especially if you have been doing yoga already, you will want to keep it up. Research shows that prenatal yoga is safe and can have benefits that include:\n\nBetter sleep\nDecreased low back pain\nIncrease in strength and flexibility (two things needed to give birth!)\nReduced stress and anxiety\nDecreased risk of preterm labor and hypertension\n\nOf course you will want to check with your doctor first to make sure this is right for you, but if you are given the go-ahead, here are some guidelines to keep in mind for prenatal yoga practicing.\n\n\n\nAvoid the super intense. Hatha yoga is a great choice. Easy vinyasa flows are good as well. Ashtanga and Bikram should be put on hold until you are back in your normal body.\nAvoid the super hot. A warm room is great, but overheating is dangerous to both you and your baby. Rather than looking for a specific temperature, listen to your own body.\nDrink plenty of water. This is for every yogi out there, but even more so for those of you carrying another human inside! You need water and he or she needs water, too.\nTwist gently or not at all. You full of “relaxin,” hormone that makes you more flexible. You will want to be careful about going too far and injuring yourself\nSkip the inversions. In addition, any pose that doesn’t feel right should be avoided. Obviously the bigger you get the more you’ll have to discern. For example, at some point lying on your belly is just not going to happen! In addition, lying flat on your back when you are very pregnant is not recommended.\n\n\n\n\nIn light of all of this information, you can look around for a yoga class that works for you or you can just stay right here at Get Healthy U.
