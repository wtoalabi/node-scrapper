Being bloated is completely different from actually gaining weight.\nThe scientific definition of bloating by the Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility is:\nBloating is defined as subjective discomfort by the patient’s sensation of intestinal gas; otherwise, abdominal distension is a visible increase in abdominal girth. \nJust because your stomach is bloated that doesn’t mean you’ve gained belly fat, it might just mean you’ve eaten something that caused an inflammatory response that is (most often) causing an increase in gas in your abdomen. \nWhat Causes Bloating?\nSome people experience bloating as a reaction to certain types of food, like dairy. \nListening to your body and taking note of what you’re eating when you feel bloated is key to figuring out which foods might irritate your system. \nSome people experience bloating as a result of eating too much or eating too quickly. \nWhatever the reason for your bloating, there are plenty of healthy foods (that also taste great!) that help reduce and prevent bloating.\nIf you’re looking for a solution to bloating and want to eat something today that will help you look and feel better by tomorrow, you’re in the right place. \nThis is our list of the BEST foods (and drinks!) to fight bloat!\nWays to Debloat in 24 Hours\nMore Water, No Salty Foods\nIf you want to reduce bloating in a day, the only beverage you should drink is water and lots of it.\nThough it may seem counterintuitive, the more water you drink, the better. And it’s not just about the amount of water you drink, but when.\nWater helps to flush out toxins and waste from your body through urination so drinking more fluids will help with digestion. It helps to nix the effects of those salty foods, too.\nDrinking lots of liquids actually makes you feel full because there is less room for food in your stomach as well which can lead to decreased bloating.\nIf you’re trying to debloat quickly, drinking water is a quick and easy way to do it.\nTake a Break From Carbs – For a Day or Two\nContrary to popular belief carbs are not your enemy, they are an essential fuel source for your body.\nBut carbs are more of a double-edged sword because they bind with water more than anything – which is good for glycogen storage, but bad news when it comes to bloating.\nCarbs increase the fluid retention in your body and can make you feel bloated.\nHowever, to de-bloat, you can reduce carbohydrates for about a day or two and make the basis of your diet greens and lean proteins.\nPay Attention to Chewing\nBloating can actually be caused by the way you chew. If you chew too quickly you swallow more air – causing bloat.\nInstead of chatting while eating, make a conscious effort to eat slowly (chewing your food will increase digestion and satisfaction), and only talk in between bites.\nUnwind with Yoga\nYoga is one of the best forms of exercise because it is a low-impact, relaxing activity. When we feel stressed our bodies release cortisol, the hormone responsible for regulating blood pressure and sugar levels in the body.\nToo much cortisol can lead to problems. When cortisol is present the body reacts by releasing water and sodium which contribute to bloatedness.\nYoga helps to reduce cortisol. Yoga is also a great activity because it calms your mind so that stress doesn’t lead to those hormonal changes, digestive distress, sleep issues, or weight gain.\nThe Best Bloat Fighting Foods (And Drinks)\n1.
