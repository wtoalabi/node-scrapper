"Hey new mom, do you have 10 minutes for a workout? I can hear your answer now, as you practically laugh out loud while screaming, “No!” The demands on your time after having a baby seem to have multiplied faster than the piles of diapers in your trash. All the while you’re left to wonder how these movie stars show up in tabloids looking so slim so soon after giving birth. Where did they find the time? You can barely get in a shower let alone a workout. If this sounds like you, then our 10-Minute Postpartum Power Workout is here to save the day.\nUnfortunately, the Hollywood myth of putting on a form-fitted, size 2 dress six weeks after giving birth puts pressure on those of us who don’t have nannies, trainers, chefs, and all day to work out. Therein lies the rub: They DO have the time and the help. But perfection isn’t the goal nor is it a reality. Remember a little word called “Photoshop”? Okay, I digress. A healthier attitude for both you and baby would be to set perfection aside and just strive for a little change each day. Commit yourself to 10 minutes of movement. Give up the extra laundry for today or skip making a meal and settle on that turkey sandwich and apple for dinner. Don’t sweat the small stuff. Make it your goal to feel better, have more energy and little by little the baby weight is going to drop off too. If you can find 10 minutes, you can do this workout.\nBelow are 7 low-to-moderate impact (yet still powerful!) exercises that will get your heart rate up gently and without extra impact or jumping while your body is healing. Try to keep in mind that even when you might feel better, the healing in your body is unseen and deep inside. Time to heal is important so less jumping and bouncing is better for a while. Perform each exercise for 30 seconds then move directly to the next exercise without stopping. Once you get through all of them take 30 seconds to grab water and catch your breath then start from the top and repeat one more time. The entire routine should take about 10 minutes. After a few weeks, you may even find you are able to fit this in twice a day!\n*Note: Always consult your doctor before beginning a new exercise routine after childbirth. Keep in mind every pregnancy is different and don’t compare with other new moms. You start when YOUR body is ready.\nBasic Squat\n\n\n\n\nA) Stand tall with your feet hip distance apart.
