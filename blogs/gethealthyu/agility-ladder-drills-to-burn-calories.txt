This workout is considered a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout because it requires you to expend all-out effort for short bursts of time and then rest.\nInstructions:\n\nPerform each drill two times in a row.\nMove down the ladder, shuffle back to the beginning of the ladder again and do it one more time.\nDo that for each of the 11 ladder drills.\nTake a rest to catch your breath and then repeat all 11 again!\n\nWatch the videos for a demonstration of each move and read the description of each drill to learn how to do each move.\n1. Single Foot In Each Square\n\nPlace one foot in each square, alternating. Be sure to pick up your feet and move the full length of the ladder.\n The higher you can pick your knees up while running through the ladder, the more efficient and effective this move will be.\n2. Two Feet In Each Square\n\nPlace two feet in each square before moving onto the next. You want to stay on the balls of your feet and move your feet quickly.\nSimilar to the single foot in each square, the extra challenge to this move is to also pick up your knees. Think high knees down the ladder. This will push your heart rate further and uses a bigger range of motion.\n3. Lateral Stepping\n\n\nStand lateral to the agility ladder with your right foot ready to lead. Start going down the agility ladder by placing two feet in each square. Stay on the balls of the feet and as you move laterally; you want to keep your toes and hips facing forward the entire time until you reach the end of the ladder.\nDo this same thing on the other side, leading with the left foot. Facing laterally and sprinting down the ladder forces us to move in a different plane of motion and challenges our minds as well.\n\n4. Jumping Jack Feet\n\n\nJump two feet together inside a square, then jump out while moving down the ladder. Just as you would do regular jumping jacks, continue to use your arms in an overhead position to increase the heart rate.\nStay on the balls of the feet as you jack them out and in down the entire ladder.\n\n5. In In Out Out\n\n\nBegin by placing the right foot in the square and then the left foot. Then you will step outside of the ladder with the right foot, then the left, leaving both feet on the outside of the ladder.\nYou will follow the pattern of in in, out out, leading with the same foot as you go down the entire ladder. Once you come back, the challenge is to start with the opposite foot, making sure you are evening out your body and not always choosing the more dominant foot to lead.\n\n6. Lateral Carioca\n\n\nStart by standing on the left side of the ladder, allowing your left foot to be the leading leg. Step sideways with your lead foot (left) into the first square, then cross-step your opposite foot over the lead foot as you move to the second box.\nYou will grapevine down the entire ladder with the “non-leading” foot either stepping in front or behind the lead leg. Continue to move laterally across the ladder while focusing on quick footwork and stable hip movement. Repeat this pattern on the other side.\n\n7. Cross-Overs\n\n\nOne foot crosses front and steps into the square; two feet step to the side and then continue to repeat down the ladder. The goal is to keep one foot in the square and two feet on the side as you make your way down.\nTo quicken your pace down the ladder you want to stay on the balls of your feet and allow the hips to help with this pattern. In terms of agility drills, this is fast, fun, and a heart pumper!\n\n8. Icky Shuffle\n\n\nThis ladder drill is one of our favorite agility drills. Begin by starting on one side of the ladder (doesn’t matter which side because you will do both sides), but for our sake, we are going to start on the right side. Take a lateral step into the first square with the left foot, then immediately follow with the right foot.\nThen you will step laterally to the left side of the ladder with the left foot. The right foot will then lead into the second box.\nThe left foot will meet the right in the second square, then taking a step to the outside of the ladder on the right with the right foot. Continue down the entire ladder focusing on quickness and agility. The pattern will always be two feet into the square, one foot on the outside, but each time you will lead with the opposite leg.\n\n9. Single Foot Hops Ladder Drill\n\n\nBegin by standing on the left foot. Hop through the ladder on the left foot the entire way down the ladder.\nOnce you reach the end of the ladder and you make your way back to the starting position, you will stand on the right foot and complete the same pattern on the opposite foot.\n\n10. Side Shuffle Speed Ladder\n\n\nStart on the right side of the ladder. The right foot will always step inside each square and the left, outside foot will always be on the outside of the ladder.\nBegin by leading with the inside foot stepping into the first square. The opposite foot (left) will step on the outside of the ladder following in the footsteps.\nYou will repeat this pattern all the way down the ladder. Once returning to the start position, start on the opposite side of the ladder leading with the opposite foot. The key to quickness is staying light on the balls of your feet and a soft bend through the knees the entire way down the ladder.\n\n11. Walking Push-ups\n\n\nThis is a full-body agility drill. Start in a high plank position, shoulders stacked directly over the wrists and legs long behind you. Walk the lead arm into the first square of the ladder, squeeze your core and drop down to the bottom of a push-up. When you come to the top of the push-up you will walk your hands into the next two squares.\nMove laterally down the agility ladder, doing a push-up in each square. Make sure you take this one slow at first so you can get your form right.\nRepeat on both sides of the ladder switching the leading arm. Walking push-ups are a good way to incorporate strength movements with the agility ladder.\n\n \n\n\nWhere To Find an Agility Ladder\n\nReady to get started with an agility drill? First, you need a ladder. There are several different options if you want to do agility ladder drills right: buy a roll-out mat, one with plastic slats, or simply draw your own with chalk.\nLadders will range in price according to which variety you choose, but as you can see from the video above, I like the roll-out kind. They stay in place and are of better quality.\nThis is the kind of ladder I have, from SPRI. You can purchase one on Amazon by clicking below.\nRoll-Out Agility Ladder\n\nIf you want to make your own agility ladder using chalk or duct tape, create boxes that are roughly 16 x 13, and make the whole ladder roughly 15 ft long.\nOf course, if the dimensions of the squares aren’t precisely the same as one you’d buy online, it’s not a huge deal. Just get outdoors and move those feet to the end of the ladder!\nGive just one of these exercises a try as part of your next workout. Don’t expect to be an expert the first time, just have fun and repeat!\nAgility Ladder Drill FAQs\nAre agility ladders a good workout?\nThe agility ladder can provide you with a killer cardio workout. Just keep in mind that proper form is the priority, not how hard you push yourself! If your form starts to falter then it’s time to take a break and come back fresh for another go around later on.\nHow many calories do agility ladder drills burn?\nAgility ladder drills are very similar to high intensity interval training in terms of calorie burn. Ladder drills will burn anywhere from 300-900 calories in one hour. Be aware that calorie burn is entirely dependent on several factors like age, weight, and fitness level. For example, certain ladder drills burn more calories because the footwork is more intricate while other drills are more straightforward. Calorie burn during agility work also varies based on the intensity of the drills. You might complete one set of a drill at a warmup exertion level and then move on to another, more intense set.\nHow do I improve my agility ladder drills?\nPractice makes perfect! The only way to get better at anything is by practicing often and in different ways so that you can find what works best for your body.\nWhat does the agility ladder improve?\nAgility ladders are an easy way to get started on your fitness journey. They will help strengthen joints, ligaments, tendons as well as improving agility and quickness while also increasing your brainpower. Speed training and agility ladder drills help improve brain to muscle connection. Ladder drills also improve the ability to pivot which is an important factor for balance especially as we age.  \nHow long should an agility ladder be?\nAgility ladders come in different lengths, with their main difference being the number of rungs. Some have 8, some 11 or 12, and others 15. The more rungs an agility ladder has the smaller its spacing will be. In general agility ladder rungs are typically spaced 18 inches apart and create boxes that are 20 inches wide. The length of the ladder doesn’t matter as long as it works for you and you’re having fun!\nCan you make your own agility ladder?\nYes an agility ladder is easy to DIY. You can use a rope or jump-rope to create an agility ladder – be careful not to trip, focus on high knees! Or use a long piece of material that’s at least two feet longer than desired length for the ladders, and three short pieces about 12 inches in length. Another technique to make your own regulation agility ladder is to use a roll of duct tape and some free paint-stirring sticks.\n \n \nREAD THIS NEXT: Fun and Free Driveway Workout"
