"Working your legs is essential for your overall fitness! After all, your legs not only move you, but as the largest muscles in your body they help you perform those big calorie-burning exercises which bump up your metabolism.\nThe problem is that bad knees can get in the way—and they’re a common problem. One study from Gallup-Healthways found that 26% of the adult population in the United States suffers from knee pain. Injuries, surgeries, arthritis and runner’s knee—there are many reasons you might be experiencing knee pain, but it should never cause you to skip leg day.\nWe’re here to show you the best exercises for bad knees so you can strengthen your legs without putting stress on your knees. Learn the leg exercises for bad knees below and then we’ll show you both strength and cardio options so you can get a full-length workout done that won’t hurt your joints.\nLow Impact Workouts\nBefore we dive into the exercise modifications, let’s discuss low-impact exercise. A low-impact workout is a workout that puts less stress on your joints.\nWhat are some examples of low-impact workouts? Low impact cardio exercises include cycling, walking, or swimming. Low impact strength workouts include the use of resistance bands and limit the use of weights which can harm the joints.\nThe main purpose of low-impact workouts is to keep the pressure off your knees and other joints while still allowing you to exercise.\nLow Impact Cardio\nOne type of low-impact workout is low-impact cardio. Low impact cardio is a form of exercise that increases your heart rate while minimizing the amount of stress or impact you put on your joints. \nCardio workouts will cause your heart rate to increase as you work harder and require more oxygen, meaning you’ll need to breathe faster and deeper. Low-impact exercises still allow for the benefits of cardio without placing stress on your joints or spine.\nLow impact cardio doesn’t mean low intensity, though. Low-impact cardio workouts can still allow you to break a sweat and elevate your heart rate, just like traditional high-impact cardio.\nLow Impact Strength\nStrength training exercises that involve minimal joint impact are considered low-impact exercises. Low impact strength workouts are often done by using machines, as they reduce the risk of injury and take away some of the strain on your joints.\nAnother way to achieve low impact strength training is by incorporating exercise bands into your workout routine to get a full-body strength training experience that doesn’t put pressure on any one joint in particular. Exercise bands allow you to perform movements like push-ups or squats without putting weight on your spine, knees, and other crucial joints. Research shows that exercise programs utilizing resistance bands and tubing produce equivalent results to free weight training.\nWeight Loss With Low Impact Workouts\nCan you lose weight with a low-impact exercise? Low-impact exercises can be modified to make them more intense by involving your entire body. Some tips for making low-impact workouts more intense are:\nIncorporate upper body\nExercising with bad knees can be challenging, but there are steps that you can take to have a good workout. Upper body moves like swinging your arms when walking and raising the arms overhead during step or aerobics can help increase the intensity of your workout without causing too much discomfort for your knees. Machines at the gym that offer exercises for upper body muscles like an elliptical trainer or cross-country ski machine may also serve as a helpful workout option if you’re suffering from painful knees.\nExaggerate your movements\nAdd intensity to your exercises by using big, exaggerated movements. For example, if you were marching in place, making the movement harder by bringing the knees up high and circling the arms overhead. Sure, you might look a little silly, but it’s worth it!\nIncrease speed\nWhen it comes to your low-intensity workout routine, adding speed is one way to increase the intensity and get your heart rate up. Always be careful when increasing your speed. Pay attention to how your knees, hips, and joints feel. \n5 Exercise Modifications For Bad Knees\n\nMost leg joint pain actually stems from a lack of strength in your legs. How’s that for ironic?

These squats for bad knees will still help you work your lower body without putting pressure on your joints.\n\nLean slightly back against the ball with your feet shoulder-width apart in front of you and begin your squat.\nNot only will this take some pressure off your knees, but you’ll also be able to adjust the move on the fly to suit your own strengths and weaknesses.\nGet a feel for this and then add some dumbbells in your hand to make it harder.\n\n\n\n\nStability ball wall squat\n\nTip: Choose your range of motion—go lower if you can, but stay higher if your knee pain kicks in. The key is to sit back as you squat, keep legs hip width apart, and focus your weight in your heels!\n2. Reverse Your Lunges\nAnother essential move for toned legs, lunges work not only your leg muscles but, when done properly, they also help you fire up your glutes. The lunge that tends to hit your knees hardest is the forward lunge. So…\nTry: Reverse Lunges\nYou definitely want to practice them without any added weight, but once you get the motion down and concentrate on keeping the weight in your front foot, you’ll likely find these lunges are much easier on your knees.

Keep your knees slightly bent and legs hip width apart – but do all the work in your abs and glutes.\n4. Bridge The Gap With Bridges\nYes, you are lying on your back. No, you are not getting a break.

In particular, people often fail to work the adductor and abductors—inner and outer thighs—which work together with the hamstrings and quadriceps in keeping the leg muscles in balance and strong all the way around. This balanced approach to training your legs protects the knees and helps them stay healthy.\nSo that’s where the resistance band comes in!
