"Finding time to fit in a workout can be difficult, but it doesn’t have to be. You only need 30 minutes and your own bodyweight for this Total Body Tone Up, and it acts as a multi-tasker by taking care of both strength and cardio at the same time. You can perform it anywhere, at anytime, with no equipment needed. By combining strength exercises to build muscle with short bursts of cardio to get your heart pumping, you’ll simultaneously burn more calories and boost your metabolism. If that sounds like something you’re interested in, then read on.\nHere’s how it works: Perform each exercise below for 12 repetitions, then immediately go into a high knee run in place for 60 seconds. Need low impact? Instead of the high knee run, do a fast high knee march, pumping your arms to make up for the heart rate. Once you finish your 60-second blast, take 15 seconds to catch your breath and move on to the next move followed by another 60-second high knee run. Keep this going throughout the workout, and repeat the entire sequence two times, making for a 30-minute workout. Try to get this workout in 2-3 times a week and you’ll be feeling great in no time! The best part is there is NO EQUIPMENT NEEDED! Just you, your shoes and a little space.\nLeg Blaster \n\n\n\n\n\nThis kick-thru lunge will get your legs in shape in no time!
