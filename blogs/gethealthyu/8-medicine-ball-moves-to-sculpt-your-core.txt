"We play with balls on the playground. We toss them over the volleyball net and shoot them through hoops. We kick them and run the bases and throw them around at the beach. Balls are fun. So why not use them to put the fun back in fitness. Medicine balls are a fantastic workout tool! Perhaps their greatest asset is that they are versatile. These babies can be tossed, slammed, lifted, twisted, passed and rolled. There is almost no end to the variety of moves you can accomplish with the ball. They can by used for lower body, upper body and of course total body workouts. In this workout we are going to use a medicine ball to sculpt your core.\nBecause of the versatility of moves, the medicine ball takes your body through very functional activities—things you do in every day life like lifting, tossing, twisting and rotating. Think of all the things your core does in a day. If you strengthen the core muscles that move you through those activities, not only do you sculpt out that awesome core of yours but you are less likely to injure your back.\nRelated: Medicine Ball Core Workout\nGet ready to slam, twist, plank, toss and rotate all to help strengthen and define that beautiful six-pack!
