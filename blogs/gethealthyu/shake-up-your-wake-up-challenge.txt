So to start things off in the right direction, here are five tips to help you succeed in the Shake Up Your Wake Up Challenge!\n\n\nPrepare The Night Before\n\n\nWhether or not you should work out is not a decision to make in the morning. Your pillow and blanket will win every time. You must make up your mind the night before and make it a priority. Set the alarm (or two). Schedule it in your calendar. Lay your workout clothes out where they are easy to pop on. Set your toothbrush and toothpaste on the counter. Take 10 minutes before you go to bed to prepare as much as possible for the morning and you’ll find it much harder to make excuses for yourself come morning.\n\n\nFocus On The Outcome\n\n\nWhen you can barely pull your body out of bed, visualize how you will feel when you hit the shower after your workout all hot and sweaty, energized and ready for the day! That feeling of accomplishment, pride and strength will be so much more rewarding than a couple of extra minutes in bed.\n\n\nBuddy Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it takes accountability from a friend, co-worker or family member to make sure you’re sticking to your goals. Grab someone to join you in this challenge and encourage each other along the way. Do your workouts together or if that’s not possible; check in first thing in the morning with an encouraging note to motivate one another to get it done! Knowing you’re in this together will make you less inclined to duck out.\n\n\nGo On Auto-Pilot\n\n\nI know it sounds like odd advice, but the beauty of this challenge is that we’ve already chosen your workout or task for each day. No need to think about what you should do in the morning, simply read the calendar and do it! Does it say to drink a glass of lemon water? Okay, march to the fridge and gulp it down. Is a 10-minute workout on the calendar today? Great, grab your sneakers and get it in. We hope this challenge rids you of the “what should I do today?” question. There’s no need to stress; just follow the calendar!\n\n\nCreate a Reward System\n\n\nA healthy reward can encourage you to keep up with your goals. At the end of the week, if you’ve completed your morning workouts, choose a Friday reward. Maybe you like to get a latte from your favorite coffee shop or treat yourself to a manicure. Big or small, acknowledge the work you did this week; be proud and pat yourself on the back.\nHealthy Breakfast Recipes\nWant some additional ideas for your new healthy morning routine?
