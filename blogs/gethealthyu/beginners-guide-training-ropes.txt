"You’ve probably seen them in the gym before and wondered “what are those?!” We’re talking about the heavy training ropes (sometimes called “battle ropes”) that are popular with pro athletes and fitness newbies alike. Why are they so popular? Slamming, waving, and whipping around these heavy ropes builds strength and stamina—plus it works just about every muscle in your body and gets your heart rate up, too. It’s basically the full package! Unlike high impact activities, however, training ropes put less of a strain on your hips and knees, making training rope exercises the perfect way to get a full-body workout without hurting your joints. Let’s explore the benefits of using training ropes and then get into an awesome training rope workout you can try for yourself.\nUse the links below to quickly navigate this guide:\n\nWhat Are Training Ropes?\nBenefits Of Training Ropes\nHow To Use Training Ropes\nTraining Rope Workout\n\n\nWhat Are Training Ropes?\nTraining ropes are heavy ropes used to build strength and stamina. They come in various lengths and thicknesses, but a standard size is 40 feet long and 1.5 inches thick. These type of training ropes are commonly found in gym settings, but you can also purchase training ropes for home use that are a bit shorter. (We don’t know too many people who have 40 feet worth of room in their home gym!) SPRI makes a conditioning rope that’s 18 feet long and 1.5 inches thick that’s ideal for home use.\n\n\n\n\nThere are also training ropes with a 2 inch diameter grip, but those are often too thick and heavy for beginners to use. If you’re just starting out, stick with the 1.5 inch thickness for sure.\nRelated: The Best Home Gym Equipment Under $40\n\nBenefits Of Training Ropes\nAside from being fun (who doesn’t want to slam and whip around some ropes to mix it up every now and then??) training ropes are an amazing fitness tool. They build strength and stamina while working your entire upper body, your entire core, and even your legs since you’re in a slight squat position for many of the moves. They provide a killer cardio workout since they utilize short bursts of all-out effort (intervals) combined with a bit of rest in between. And as I’ve said for years, interval-style workouts are one of the best ways to workout smarter, not longer. Here are just a few of the benefits of training ropes:\n\nImproves your coordination\nStrengthens your arms, core, back and chest\nElevates your heart rate\nAllows you to train multiple muscle group simultaneously\nBurns up to 10 calories every minute\nThey’re a high intensity, low-impact workout that builds strength without being hard on your joints\n\n\nHow To Use Training Ropes\nYou’ll usually find training ropes at your local gym anchored to a beam or wall. They can vary in length, thickness, and weight, but they all do the same thing! Check out this quick training ropes tutorial and then read through the tips below before giving them a try.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n1. Anchor Your Ropes\nYou need to anchor training ropes around something in order to use it. If you’re at the gym, training ropes will typically already be anchored. If you’re at home, you can anchor your training ropes using the following methods:\n\nAround a tree or study pole\nThrough a heavy kettlebell\nAn actual anchor, which you can buy here on Amazon\nUse a human anchor. Grab a partner and have them put their feet on the rope and stand there. Switch places as you both use the ropes taking turns.\n\n2. Grip The Ropes\nHold the ropes right at the handles. You can use two different grips: overhand or underhand. If you’re using overhand, pretend like you’re shaking hands. For underhand, hold the ropes like you’re signing into a microphone. Some moves will feel more comfortable in different positions. For most, you’ll use an overhand grip.\n3. Slam It & Whip It Good\nThe motion of using the ropes is supposed to be fluid—your arms are not supposed to be like two by fours and the ropes are not supposed to be like two by fours! Grip the handles and take one giant step forward so there’s some slack in the rope. Keep an athletic-ready stance with your knees slightly bent and move your arms from hip to head. Remember to keep your core engaged the entire time! There are tons of different moves you can do like the single or double wave, snake whips, and more.
