"If you’ve never heard of Tabata intervals before, they’re about to become your new BFF when it comes to burning fat, toning your muscles, and getting an effective workout checked off your list in less time. Sound appealing? Read on to learn the difference between Tabata and HIIT, where Tabata originated from, and why it’s a super effective way to work both your aerobic and anaerobic systems. And then get ready, because we’ve got a beginner Tabata workout you can try for yourself at home!\nWhat Is Tabata? Is It Different From HIIT?\nTechnically, Tabata is a form of High Intensity Interval Training, or HIIT. HIIT is one of the best ways to burn fat, as it utilizes intense periods of all-out effort paired with short periods of rest. These intervals accelerate fat loss and help you achieve more with your workouts in a shorter amount of time. HIIT intervals can be any amount of time, but Tabata intervals specifically use the following time frame:\n\nWork hard for 20 seconds\nRest for 10 seconds\n\nWhere Did Tabata Come From?\nTabata intervals were developed by Dr. Izumi Tabata and fellow researchers at the National Institute Of Fitness and Sports in Tokyo because of some interesting findings on the intensity levels of different workouts and what they do for the body. Dr. Tabata and his research team found that working out using intense intervals allowed athletes to work both their aerobic (cardio) and anaerobic (muscle) systems at the same time, while working out at a more moderate intensity only worked the athletes aerobic systems.\nThe Benefits of Tabata Training\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing high intensity interval training in general, and specifically Tabata, you can get your heart pumping while still building muscle. As you probably know by now, you need both cardio and strength training to maintain a healthy weight and keep your metabolism functioning properly. (The more muscle you have, the faster your metabolism works.) So checking two things off your to-do list at once is what Tabata training is all about!\n\nWorks your Aerobic and Anaerobic Systems. As stated above, Tabata intervals work both your aerobic and anaerobic systems, meaning they’re a cardiovascular and strength workout all in one!\nHelps You Retain or Build Muscle. When you’re trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, you can sometimes lose muscle along with fat. You want to ideally lose fat while retaining muscle, and Tabata workouts do just that by placing stress on the muscles, which tells your body that more muscle tissue is needed.\nRevs Your Metabolism. Intense interval workouts increase your metabolism, helping you burn calories and fat even after you’re done exercising.\nSaves Time. Steady state cardio is great, but you have to do it for a longer period of time to burn calories and see a difference in fat loss. More effective at targeting fat loss are workouts like Tabata which utilize higher intensity intervals.\n\nRelated: The Beginner’s Guide to HIIT\n10-Minute Beginner Tabata Workout\nNow that you’ve learned about Tabata, let’s get down to the workout!
