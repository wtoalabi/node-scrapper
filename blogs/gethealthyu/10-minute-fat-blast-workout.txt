"When you haven’t worked out in a while, the thought of starting back up again can be intimidating. Where do you begin? What equipment will you need? How can you start burning calories and fat fast? The good news is, if you’re looking to burn fat, I’ve got a quick workout you can do right now, right where you are—no equipment necessary—and I think you’re going to love it! All you’ll need for this quick, fat blasting routine is a little room to move around and 10 minutes. Because these are all high intensity moves, you will be breathing heavy after the first 2-minute round. You will then rest for 1 minute (you can thank me later) and repeat this sequence 3 times. The plyometric moves (jumping) work to get your heart rate elevated and help you burn fat faster!\nHere’s how it looks: \n\n1 minute of light jogging in place to warm up\n\n\nPerform each exercise for 30 seconds with no rest in between\n\n\nAfter finishing all four, rest for 1 minute and repeat the sequence 2 more times\n\nBam! About 100 calories blasted in just 10 minutes. Another side effect—you’ll be wide awake and full of energy!  PS: drink some water when you are done, you will need it!\nDiamond Jacks\n\nA) Start with legs wider than shoulder distance apart, turn the toes out, and bend knees in a wide plié position.
