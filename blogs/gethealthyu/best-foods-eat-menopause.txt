"Menopause comes with plenty of unpleasant symptoms, from hot flashes and brain fog to insomnia and mood swings. But what exactly defines your menopausal years, and what can you do to make the transition as seamless as possible? Typically in your early 50s, menopause occurs when you’ve gone a full year without a period. (The exact time frame varies greatly, with an average range of 45-55). There are so many things you can do to help your body through this change even years in advance. One of the best ways to take charge of your hormonal health is through your diet. Let’s explore the specific hormonal changes that occur during this time and the best foods to eat during your perimenopausal and menopausal years.\nPerimenopause vs. Menopause\nFew people actually talk about the difference between perimenopause and menopause, often lumping them together under the umbrella term as menopause. But the truth is, you go through two distinct changes during each of these times. Perimenopause—known as the change before the change—is when you’re most likely to start noticing some of the symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, and mood swings, and it can start as early as 10 years prior to menopause. Your body is ending its fertile years, on the way to menopause your estrogen and progesterone can fluctuate and play crazy games on you. Furthermore, once you do hit menopause—the all-time low levels of all hormones can put you at risk for health conditions like osteoporosis and heart disease.   \nThat might sound scary, but “by making some changes to your eating habits you might be able to ease a lot of the discomfort and keep your body healthier as you age,” says Sherry Ross, MD, an ob-gyn at St. John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Here are five dietary moves worth making when menopause is on the horizon.\nThe Best Foods To Eat During Menopause\nThe following are key nutrients that can help bring your body back into balance during the transition to menopause and specific foods that fall under each category.
