"Oh, to have the time of day to leisurely shower, blow dry our hair and change into a darling new outfit after every workout. But that’s just not realistic for us, and we’re guessing the same goes for you. That’s why we’re all about incorporating our activewear into put-together outfits that work for any occasion (okay, maybe not a Gala). We’ve found new ways to pair our favorite workout staples (leggings, workout headbands, tops and running shoes, to start) with winter’s best looks to keep us warm and take us from studio to street in no time flat. By starting with some workout basics in fun colors, transitioning from your workouts to the your next event doesn’t have to be difficult. Here are 6 easy ways to still look refined this winter after even the most intense sweat session:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.From Pilates to Party\nPilates is perfect for on-the-go women: it’s a sure-fire way to tone up and see positive results and you have an excuse to wear adorable workout clothes.
