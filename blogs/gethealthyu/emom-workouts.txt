"What kind of workout is super time-efficient, adaptable to any goal, suitable for all fitness levels and really easy to follow?\nAnswer: EMOM workouts!\nThat’s right! If you’re a fan of fun, fast-moving workouts that keep your attention and shorten your workout time than you definitely need to try EMOM workouts!\nJump To EMOM Workouts\n\n5-Minute Upper Body EMOM Workout\n5-Minute Lower Body EMOM Workout\n5-Minute Total Body EMOM Workout\n5-Minute Cardio Conditioning EMOM Workout\n5-Minute Full Body Bodyweight EMOM Workout\n\nWhat Is An EMOM Workout?\n\n\n\n\n\nEMOM is an acronym that stands for “every minute on the minute”.\nEMOM workouts have become more popular in recent years as Crossfit training uses this type of methodology. This is a super fun, unique way to change up your workout by giving you a pre-determined number of repetitions to perform in a given amount of time.\nIt’s this simple: if you get all of your reps done before time is up, you get to rest. The sooner you finish your reps, the longer you get to rest.\nFor example, if the exercise given is 12 push-ups in one minute, then you do your 12 push-ups when the minute begins and when you are finished you get to rest with whatever time is left until the next minute starts. If you finish in 30 seconds, you get 30 seconds to rest. If you finish in 45, you get 15 seconds to rest.\nOf course, it is crucial to stick with proper form and range of motion, but the timing gives you an extra desire to push a little harder so you have more time to rest before the next minute begins\nBenefits of EMOM Workouts\nWhat do you value most in a workout? Most of us want something that is super effective but doesn’t take all day. If so, the EMOM format is another great tool to throw into your box of goodies!\nSimilar to a HIIT workout, the EMOM workout conditions your body to work at a high rate of energy resulting in EPOC, or “excess post-exercise oxygen consumption.”\nThis means that even after you finish the workout you have pushed so hard that your body continues to burn calories long into the rest of your day. GOALS!\nAccording to ACE, (American Council on Exercise) “EPOC is influenced by the intensity not the duration of exercise.” Translation? Getting your heart rate up with short, intense intervals like those that occur in an EPOC format will provide more benefits to calorie burning than a long, slow walk.\nIn addition, ACE rightly declares “exercise that uses more oxygen burns more calories.” Simply put: the harder you are breathing the more calories you are burning. That is one of the unique benefits of working through the challenges of an EMOM workout.\nOf course, there are tons of other great benefits to the EMOM format. Here are just a few:\n\nFor All Fitness Levels\n\nWhether you are a seasoned athlete or someone who casually works out three days a week, EMOM’s can be adapted to a wide variety of fitness levels. EMOM workouts can be created with barbells and other highly specified training equipment to push athletes to their limits, or they can be designed with simple bodyweight moves that anyone, anywhere can undertake.\nEven within the same workout, beginners can move at a different level or be given a different number of reps than those who are more advanced. This is super adaptable and great for everyone!\nThe one caveat to throw in is that if you have been completely sedentary, jumping into an EMOM workout is not a good place to start. Due to the pacing of this type of workout, it’s important you have a basic understanding of how to do simple exercises ahead of time and work through those first. So get your body into movement mode, learn how to master a basic squat, lunge, push-up, etc. and THEN you can utilize that knowledge at a base level in this EMOM style.\n\nMeets Different Fitness Goals\n\nEndurance? Yes! Strength? Yes! Cardio? Uh-huh! The beauty of EMOM workouts it that you can tailor the workout to fit your specific goals. If you are looking for strength, your EMOM will use heavier weights and fewer reps. If you are looking for cardio you may do explosive bodyweight moves or use lighter weights with more reps. It’s less about the “what” and more about the “how many and how fast?”\n\nSuper Time Efficient\n\nIs an EMOM workout effective? Absolutely, and it’s efficient. Got 10 minutes? EMOM is perfect for you. Rather go for 30? EMOMs are perfect for you too.\nThe beauty of the EMOM workout is they can be flexible to the time the participant has. They are super time-efficient, meaning you can work extremely hard in a very short time period of time.\n\nGreat For Group Settings Or Going Solo\n\nEMOM workouts are perfect for group training sessions, like Crossfit. Set up stations with the number of reps having participants move around the room, or, have everyone working the same moves but each going at their specific pace.\nOn the other hand, if you’re looking for a workout you can do on your own, there are great EMOM workouts to choose from online (including the ones below!). Look for one that fits your style and level and follow along at your own pace. So what is an EMOM workout good for? Solo or in a group, EMOM workouts are for you.\n\n5 EMOM Workouts To Do At Home\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to give it a try? Here are 5 simple EMOM workouts you can do right at home.
