For instance, studies have shown that strength training after 50 reduces your risk of:\n\n\n\nArthritisDiabetesOsteoporosisObesityBack painDepressionHeart DiseaseStroke\n\n\n\nHere are some other things to consider regarding exercise as an older adult:\n\n\n\nIncreases Your Quality of Life\n\n\n\nPeople who exercise after 50 have been shown to be happier, healthier, have more energy and have sharper minds. That’s a pretty good bargain! The later years should be just as good as the early ones!\n\n\n\nImproves Mental Health\n\n\n\nDepression affects approximately 9.5% of U.S adults each year. According to studies by the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry is has been well established that exercise decreases symptoms of depression!\n\n\n\nIn addition, exercise increases endorphins – the happy hormone that boosts your mood. The key here is not quantity of exercise, rather regularity of an exercise schedule.\n\n\n\nBuilds Stronger Bones\n\n\n\nBoth strength training and certain cardio activities increase your bone density, making it less likely to break things if you fall.\n\n\n\nAccording to the CDC, falls are the leading cause of injury and death in older Americans. One bad fall as an older adult can change your life forever. Keep those bones strong.\n\n\n\nTames Menopause Symptoms\n\n\n\nFor women over 50, menopause is another adventure that comes with the aging process.\n\n\n\nThe Mayo Clinic recommends regular exercise to help lessen menopause issues such as weight gain around the tummy, hot flashes, joint pain, and sleep problems.\n\n\n\nRelated: How To Deal With The 10 Most Common Menopause Symptoms\n\n\n\n\nExercising As You Age\n\n\n\nSo it is well-established that exercise is a good idea as you get older. However, it is also important to recognize that aging bodies need to exercise appropriately!\n\n\n\nWorking out at 50 or 60 is going to look different than working out at 20 or 30. Here are some things to consider.\n\n\n\nBody Changes After 50\n\n\n\nOne of the things that gets tricky for those who continue to exercise during the second half of life is the reality of an aging body.\n\n\n\nIt might be hard to admit, but no matter how healthy you are and how well you’ve cared for your body, it changes. Joints wear out, bones lose density, muscles aren’t as strong, but all the while you want to keep moving.\n\n\n\nHow do you do it? Here are some challenges and solutions to exercising in an older body.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happens As Your Joints Age?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoints are the areas in your body where your bones come together. Joints are amazing because they are what make you flexible and able to move in so many different ways.\n\n\n\nThe joints (space where bones meet) contain cartilage, which cushions your bones. Joints are also surrounded by synovial membranes filled with fluid.\n\n\n\nAs we age, the cartilage experiences wear and tear from years of movement and consequently, inflammation occurs.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the joints become more stiff and less flexible as the fluid decreases and you have less cushioning. It is as if your shock absorbers are wearing out so you begin to feel sore more often.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nTake advantage of low impact options.\n\n\n\nBe smart about saving yourself for years to come. Instead of a squat jump, do a squat and reach overhead as you stand. No jumping needed.\n\n\n\nInstead of running, switch to power walking. Focus more on large, range-of-motion movements that can give you a heart rate boost without all the impact.\n\n\n\nWe need to be smarter about exercise as we age so even if you feel able to continue with lots of high impact, it will be in your best interest to switch to low impact more often.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happens As Your Muscles Age?\n\n\n\nMuscles change as we age as well. Muscle tissue breaks down, muscles become more rigid, and we lose muscle mass. The number and size of muscle fibers decrease with age.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nEven those of us who continue to strength train will experience this some muscle loss.\n\n\n\nHowever, if you are able to strength train after the age of 50 you will slow down muscle loss significantly and be able to maintain a stronger, healthier and younger body for much longer than those who do not.\n\n\n\nStay consistent with your muscle work! In addition, strength training will help protect those aging joints we mentioned earlier.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happens As Your Bones Age?\n\n\n\nBone is a living tissue. As we age, hormonal changes, loss of calcium and minerals and inactivity cause our bones to be weaker.\n\n\n\nWe have less and less of this bone tissue in our body, which weakens our bones and makes it easier for them to break.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nInclude weight-bearing activities in your weekly workout plan. Bones benefit from weight-bearing exercise.\n\n\n\nWalking, lifting weights, or any weight-bearing activity increases your bone density and helps keep you stronger. And be careful that you don’t switch to 100% “no impact”.\n\n\n\nNo impact includes things likes swimming or the recumbent bicycle. While these activities are good to include in an overall workout plan, be sure you don’t take away all of the weight bearing.\n\n\n\nIn other words, if you love swimming or water aerobics – great! BUT, include some weight bearing activity as well such as walking.\n\n\n\n\nYour Workout Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it’s time to get started on your workout plan. Here are some things to consider for working out over 50 and a few suggested plans you can consider:\n\n\n\nCheck with your doctor: Especially if it has been a while, this is a great time to get a physical and discuss exercise options with your doctor. Make sure you are clear for the activities you desire to do.Balance your workouts: You know you should eat a balanced diet, but you should also have a balanced workout plan. Include some cardiovascular activity, some strength training and some flexibility (i.e. stretching). As discussed before, some weight-bearing activity should be included.\n\n\n\nCardio exercise ideas: cycling, power walking, dance-style fitness, elliptical trainer.\n\n\n\nStrength training ideas: dumbbells or barbells, body-weight training, resistance bands, medicine balls.\n\n\n\nFlexibility ideas: yoga classes, stretching videos, online flexibility workouts.\n\n\n\nStart small and build. If you are new to exercise, start small. 10-15 minutes each day for a week might be a good place to start. Add a few more minutes each week until you can build up to a solid 30-minutes or more. In addition, keep your intensity low to moderate at first. Make sure you can carry on conversation while moving. Once you begin to develop stamina, you can increase your workload so that you are only able to say a few words or short phrases during movement.Try intervals. One of the quickest ways to get in shape is by using interval training. Add fast spurts of movement throughout the workout. So whether walking or doing the elliptical trainer, warm up for 10 minutes, then go as fast as you can for 30 seconds. Slow back down to moderate for a few minutes, then go hard for 30 seconds again. After 8 intervals you’ve got a great workout!\n\n\n\nTaking everything you’ve read into account, it’s time to put a plan into action.\n\n\n\nHere are a few sample plans for how you might lay out your week to balance working out over 50.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind you can and should substitute your exercise of choice in the proper place. For instance, if the cardio exercise suggested is power walking but you prefer to cycle, then make that substitution.\n\n\n\nPlan A Sample Workout Week:\n\n\n\nSUNDAY: 30 minutes power walking\n\n\n\nMONDAY: 30 minutes strength training\n\n\n\nTUESDAY: 20 minutes flowing yoga\n\n\n\nWEDNESDAY: 30 minutes power walking\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY: 30 minutes strength training\n\n\n\nFRIDAY: 20 minutes flowing yoga\n\n\n\nSATURDAY: 30 minutes power walking\n\n\n\nPlan B Sample Workout Week:\n\n\n\nSUNDAY: 15 minutes jogging/15 minutes strength upper body\n\n\n\nMONDAY: 15 minutes swimming/15 minutes strength lower body\n\n\n\nTUESDAY: 30 minutes yoga/pilates fusion\n\n\n\nWEDNESDAY: 15 minutes elliptical/15 minutes strength upper body\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY: 15 minutes cycling/15 minute strength lower body\n\n\n\nFRIDAY: 30 minutes power yoga\n\n\n\nSATURDAY: Rest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips For Working Out Over 50\n\n\n\nHere are some final helpful tips before you head into the world of fitness over 50.\n\n\n\nChoose what you love: Doing something you enjoy will give you a better shot at consistency.
