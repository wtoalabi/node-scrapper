"The key to staying consistent with any exercise program is to choose movement you actually enjoy.\nFor instance, if you choose a running program but you really don’t like to run, it’s going to be hard to keep a consistent exercise plan when motivation wanes.\nOne of the reasons we love full-body circuit workouts is that they are NEVER boring! Circuits are a fun, interesting way to move because they involve so many different exercises from one moment to the next.\nAnd best of all, you strengthen your full body during this workout so you make the most of the time you have by getting is all done at once!\nBenefits of Circuit Workouts\n\n\n\n\n\nCircuit training is a diverse and fast-moving program that continually changes and keeps your interest up. Just as you get going with one exercise, it is time to move on to the next one. This means that even if you aren’t thrilled with the movement you are doing at the time, you have the luxury of knowing it is about to change to something else.\nCircuit training can be done in a variety of ways. Maybe you’ve seen or participated in circuits that are pre-set around the room where you move from one station to the next, each station having a different exercise to accomplish. Those are fun and popular!\nOn the other hand, if you are at home in a smaller space you can do circuits without moving from one station to another. Rather, you create each station right where you are by simply changing up the moves.\nOur full-body circuit workout below allows you to gain the benefits of circuit training without the need for all the space and equipment needed to make stations.\nBenefits of Full Body Workouts\nAnother benefit of our full-body circuit workout is that we get it all done in one setting!\nLeg day is always hard. Upper body day is a fun challenge. Full body day, on the other hand, is the best use of your time because you’re able to accomplish everything in one session.\nNot only that, but the compound dynamic moves in this workout will get your heart rate way up so that you accomplish the cardio benefits alongside the strength!\nThis full-body circuit workout is perfect for people who don’t have hours to spend on exercise but want a balanced, well-rounded workout that leaves you feeling accomplished!\nFull Body Circuit Workout\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nThis full-body circuit workout is not only fast-moving and fun, but it targets every muscle in your body so that by the time you are done you’ve burned loads of calories and feel amazingly accomplished!\nPerform the exercises below as listed without breaks in between. Move directly from one to the next without stopping until you finish the entire set.\nIf you’re looking for a power session, go through the circuit twice.
