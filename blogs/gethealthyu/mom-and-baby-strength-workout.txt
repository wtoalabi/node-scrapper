According to The Mayo Clinic, if you had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery it’s generally safe to begin light, easy exercise as soon as you feel ready—up to a few days after giving birth (not that we are suggesting you rush home from the hospital to do squats…). If you’ve had a C-section, extensive vaginal repair, or a complicated birth, talk to your health care provider about when to start an exercise program.\nIn terms of more intense activity or strength training, it will take longer before your body is prepared. For the workout below it’s probably best to wait about 6 weeks since you’ll be lifting, pushing and squatting. The best thing you can do is ask your doctor to be sure you are safe.
