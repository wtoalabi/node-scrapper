"Full body roll-ups are an exercise that strengthens your core and helps lengthen and stretch your back and hamstrings. The full range of motion used in this exercise engages more muscle fibers than many core exercises.\nIf you learn how to do full body roll-ups you will be learning one of the most standard pilates exercises there is.\n \nUse the links below to quickly navigate this guide:\n\nWhat is Pilates?\nHow To Do Full Body Roll-Ups\nWhat Muscles Do Full Body Roll-Ups Work\nBenefits of Full Body Roll-Ups\nHow Many Calories Do Full Body Roll-Ups Burn\nOther Exercises Similar To Full Body Roll-Ups\nIncorporating Full Body Roll-Ups Into Your Workouts\n\nWhat is Pilates?\nJoseph Pilates created Pilates almost 100 years ago. Originally called Contrology, the practice is all about slow controlled movements that deliver serious results. When done correctly, Pilates requires a true mind/body connection and sculpts the abs like no other exercise routine I’ve ever tried.\nHaving taught this method for the past 10 years (and managing my own chronic back pain with it), I can’t help but throw in a few Full Body Roll-Ups at the end of most of my live and on-demand classes.\nNow let’s go back to anatomy class for a minute. As I always say, knowledge is power! If you want a powerful core, let’s solve the mystery of your ab muscles. You have four main abdominal muscles:\nRectus Abdominis – The rectus abdominis runs vertically, flexes the core and is the crunching muscle responsible for creating the ever coveted six-pack.\nExternal and Internal Obliques – The external and internal obliques run diagonally on the side of the torso. They flex the trunk forward, back and sideways and are responsible for rotation of the trunk.\nTransversus Abdominis – The transverse abdominis is deep muscle that runs horizontally around your body and often is referred to as your low abs.  I call it your “human girdle” because it helps secure and protect your low back while stabilizing and tightening your low belly. You can locate it by placing your hand below your belly button and coughing. This is the muscle I am always telling you to keep engaged.\nFull body roll-ups train the rectus abdominus and the transverse abdominus – the upper and lower abs all in the same move.\nAs you slowly roll your body off the floor, you focus on exhaling which helps to pull your ab muscles in and avoid relying on momentum to move. In turn, when you are rolling back down to the floor you use your breath again to help control the descending motion. The strength that builds in your core during this exercise is phenomenal! But it doesn’t end there. All the while you are relying on your core muscle to move you, you are also stretching out your back and hamstrings with each and every roll up.\nPutting full body roll-ups into your weekly exercise routine is one of the smartest moves you can make. It is a great way to warm up gently and prepare the body for more, but also an excellent cool-down at the end of any workout.\nBack troubles?

Exhale as you roll the entire torso up and over legs keeping abs engaged and reaching for toes.\n3) Inhale as you begin rolling your spine back down one vertebra at a time and exhale as the upper portion of the back lower and arms reach pack overhead.  Repeat moving slowly and using the abdominals to lift and lower, not momentum.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nWhat Muscles Do Full Body Roll-Ups Work?\nFull Body Roll Up is an awesome core strength move that works your abdominal muscles, lower back and stabilizers and stretches your entire backside.\n\nBenefits of Full Body Roll-Ups\nThere are many reasons you should incorporate Full Body Roll-Up into your workouts. Here are just a few:\nHealthier Low Back\nThe Full Body Roll Up is a move that focuses on stability, strength and overall health of your core and low back. In addition, this move stretches the muscles of the lower back keeping them more flexible. Moves like the Full Body Roll Up will help you avoid low back pain and injury by keeping the muscles that surround your spine strong and flexible.\nSculpts Your Abs\nThere are so many exercises available for getting sculpted abs. Crunches, planks and all of their variations are the most commonly used. Full Body Roll Up is unique. This move gives you a new and fresh option for sculpting your abs! Based in Pilates, you will find that this move is extremely effective but also feels good while you’re doing it!\nImproves Flexibility\nThe Full Body Roll Up is great for strengthening your core, but it is also an excellent stretch for the entire backside of your body. You stretch your hamstrings, lower back and upper back with the slow, controlled motion.\n\nHow Many Calories Do Full Body Roll-Ups Burn?\nPeople often ask how many calories they are burning in their workouts. Most exercises will generally burn about 100 calories for every 10 minutes you are working at high intensity. Bottom line – the harder you work, the more calories you burn.
