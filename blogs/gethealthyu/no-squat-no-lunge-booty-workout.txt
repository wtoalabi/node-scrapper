"Are you there yet? Are you at the point where one more squat or lunge during a butt workout might just have you pulling your hair out? We’ve got a no squat butt workout that will get your booty in shape – no lunges required.\nYou’ve heard it before and you’ll hear it again: the best way to tone your backside are those two nasty words, squat, and lunge. Every fitness expert around seems to agree on that one fact.\nTherefore, the squat—and its fraternal twin, the lunge—tend to show up in nearly every workout you come across. So you’re doing them.\nYou’ve done every version of them: on balls, with bands, holding weights, over Bosus, and even in walking patterns.\nYou’ve done so many of them, you can’t do them anymore. There’s got to be another way! Or at least other choices to fill in when the “S” and “L” words are driving you bonkers.\nDo Squats and Lunges Really Work?\nFirst and foremost, let’s get this on the table: there’s a reason squats and lunges have become the go-to moves for trainers and fitness specialists—they work! \nThey work your entire lower body, including the glutes, quads, hamstrings, hips, and thighs. In addition, they are functional in nature.\nDon’t throw them out! However, something else we know about fitness is that mixing up your workouts is good. The American Council on Exercise states two good reasons for mixing up your workouts:\n\nTo prevent workout boredom\nTo keep you from hitting a plateau\n\nIn other words, your body ceases to change if you do the same thing over and over. In addition, some people are unable to do squats and/or lunges due to injury, arthritis or post-surgery recovery. So let’s add something new to the mix!\nLet’s pull out a different tool, the resistance band, and see (and feel!) just what it can do for your backside.\nHow A Resistance Band Helps Tone Your Lower Body\nThe resistance band is one of the most effective and yet underutilized tools around. This inexpensive, light and portable device packs a punch for your workouts, forcing you to use different muscle groups and perform different ranges of motion than you’re body is used to. We have incorporated the band into the exercises below.\nChoose your resistance from the thicker, more challenging bands to the thinner and less intense ones. The following moves are designed to tighten up your booty sans any form of a squat or lunge. So relax, be guilt-free; you’re not alone. Many others will read the title of this workout and be joining in right along with you.\nNo Squat, No Lunge Better Booty Workout\nThis workout requires a resistance band. For each of the following exercises, perform 12 reps. Once you have gone through the entire routine, start at the top and go again. Three times through will provide optimal results—but two will give you the tightness you are looking for if you add this to your workout routine two to three times a week.\nWhen you finish the entire sequence, begin at the top and repeat a second and maybe even third time! Don’t forget to stretch out those glutes afterwards—they just might be feeling it tomorrow!
