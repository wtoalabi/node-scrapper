"There is no denying the plank is a kick-butt multi-tasking exercise! Forget doing an endless amount of crunches and add some planks to your workout routine. The primary muscles involved are your abdominal muscles and your back muscles. But hold on … not only does the plank target your abdominal and back muscles, you also will be working your shoulders, chest, glutes and legs. That’s right my friends, it’s a multi-tasking, effective exercise and it doesn’t require any equipment! All you need to perfect your plank is your own body weight.\nBenefits of the Plank\nIf you don’t know already, here are some reasons why you should plank:\n• Improve your posture\n• Sit and stand straighter\n• Walk taller\n• Flatten and tone your abs\n• Increase your power and stability\n• Reduce lower back pain\n\nYour body position should be straight, like a wooden plank.\nStart in the standard push-up position: face down, hands shoulder-width apart directly below the shoulders, balancing on your toes with your abs contracted.\nBe mindful not to let your chest or low back sag.\nKeep your body straight from head to heel. Don’t drop your head down or crank your neck back.\nUse a mirror to check your form.\nGo for quality of form over quantity of time. The more your core muscles improve, the longer you will be able to hold this position. I go crazy when I see people in the gym holding their plank with atrocious form. I remind my classes every day to perfect their plank form in order to benefit. If your back is sagging, your hips are lifted, or your neck is dropped, you are wasting your time. Once you have the form thing down, start with 15 seconds and build up from there. Work up to holding it for one to two minutes.\nRelated: The Ultimate 8 Minute Plank Challenge\nPlank Variations\nOnce you can hold your plank for a minute or two with good form, try adding a challenge.
