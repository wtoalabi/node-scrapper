Not only will you develop amazing upper-body strength, but your core also will reap all the benefits.\nYour lats, rhomboids, rear delts, and the rest of your backside will tone-up which means better posture and the illusion of a smaller waist! Bonus.\n\nExercises To Progress On Your Pull-Ups\nMake sure you warm-up properly. Anytime you strength train, you want to focus on warming up your spine and targeting the large muscle groups.\nSome of my favorite ways to warm-up before working my upper-body include a five-minute jog, incline treadmill walk, or jump roping; followed by 5 minutes of sun salutations or a 30-second plank hold on my knees.  Last, 30 seconds of knee push-ups.\nTry incorporating the exercises below into your workouts.\nWe can’t tell you exactly how many weeks it will take until you can do the full pull up. But usually in 4 weeks or so, you will gain enough strength to pump one out and be super proud!\nSuspension Trainer Pull-Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA) Grab a TRX suspension-training strap (Familiarize yourself with suspension training here.) and bring it to a fully shortened length. Place yourself directly underneath the anchor point and extend your feet straight out in front of you and grab both handles with your arms straight, palms facing each-other. \nB) Bring your shoulders down and back and, without arching your lower back, think about using the strength in your upper back to bring your chest towards the handles. Slowly lower back to starting position.\nC) Do 8-10 reps; 3 sets; 3 times a week. (Keep adding a few reps as you get stronger.)\nBand Assisted Pull-Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA) Secure a Superband (most gyms should have these) around a pull-up bar. (If you are new to strength training try the 1 ¾” wide superband. If you can already do pushups, try the 1” superband.) Grab a chair or step to place yourself underneath the bar. Carefully, bring one knee in to the banded loop. The band should be secured a little past your knee (shin area) to prevent it from flying up. Take a medium to wide grip on the bar with palms facing down.\nB) Bring your shoulders down and back and, without arching your lower back, use your upper and middle back muscles, pull your chest towards the bar. Try to attempt to get your chin past the bar. With control (no swinging movements) return to starting position.\nC) Do 8-10 reps; 3 sets; 3 times a week. (Keep adding a few reps as you get stronger.)\nHorizontal Pull-Up/Inverted Row\n\n\n\n\n\nA) Find a bar that is waist-high or a little lower. You can use a secure smith machine or barbell on a squat rack for this exercise. Place yourself directly underneath the bar so that your chest is directly underneath the bar. Place your palms in an over-hand grip position in a wide grip position. You can place your legs straight out in front of you or you can bend your knees with feet flat on the ground for less resistance.\nB) Bring your shoulders down and back and without arching your lower back, bring your chest towards the bar while flexing your elbows. With control, slowly lower yourself back to starting position.\nC) Do 8-10 reps; 3 sets; 3 times a week.

Attempt to bring your chin above the bar.  With control, slowly lower back down to reach full-arm extension. Remember to inhale on the way up and exhale on the way down. Whoo hoo- you did it!\n\nProper Form of Pull-Ups For Beginners\n\nExtend fully. It’s important that you fully extend your arms in between reps. (Yes it’s harder, but correct.)\nLead with your chest. Keep your shoulders back to avoid injury.\nTry to get your chin above the bar. It’s super hard but I see lots of people release the movement before the chin is lifted fully above the bar.\nBend your knees.  Otherwise, your feet may touch the ground when your arms are extended.  Plus, it makes it easier to focus on your upper body.\n\nPull-ups are an effective way to sculpt your core, improve your posture and increase your strength!
