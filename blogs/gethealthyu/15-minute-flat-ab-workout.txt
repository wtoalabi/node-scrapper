If you want to lose fat, you have to lose it all over.\nGetting rid of belly fat and sculpting the muscles underneath requires both changing your diet and ramping up your workouts.

Get 150 Minutes of Heart-Pumping Cardio Per Week\nAs we said above, if you want to lose belly fat, you have to lose weight all over. You have to shed your “extra layer” to see the muscles underneath. Cardio is a part of the weight loss equation.\nThe CDC recommends 2 hours and 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week, which can include anything from jogging, jumping rope, cycling, or a spin class. There is no one right way to raise your heart rate, so pick what you like to do.\nThe bottom line is: you need to create a calorie deficit to lose weight (more to come on that below) so doing some cardio will help with that math equation. The bonus is you will strengthen your heart muscle and your stamina.  Since heart disease is the number one killer of women in America, taking care of your heart should be high on your self care list for overall health and calorie burning.\nTo get started with cardio, try these 7 best cardio workouts for weight loss.\n2. Fit in HIIT 1-2 Times Per Week\nIf you are willing to give HIIT a try as part of your cardio prescription, High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is a top choice for anyone looking to burn fat. HIIT helps burn fat and torch more calories in a shorter amount of time than other workouts.\nHere’s how it works: You give maximum effort through quick, intense bursts of exercise followed by short recovery periods. HIIT workouts train and condition both your aerobic and anaerobic energy systems. This kind of exercise gets your heart rate up and improves your cardiovascular fitness level while burning more fat and calories in less time.\nConsider HIIT your intense workouts, while your cardio workouts are more steady-state. You need a mix of both!\n3. Do Ab-Toning Workouts\nLike we said above, you can’t spot reduce fat in any area of your body. However, you can absolutely work to tone specific areas by using specific exercises.\nFirst things first: it’s important to understand the different types of abdominal muscles. To get rid of belly fat, you have to target all the muscles of your stomach, not just one. You need to do exercises that target the rectus abdominus, transverse abdominus and the obliques.\nThe rectus abdominus muscle is that straight-down-the-middle muscle that, if strengthened enough, is where your “six pack” shows up. The basic crunch is great for working this muscle but not the only worthy ab exercise.\nYou should also aim to strengthen your transverse abdominus, the muscle that sits deep and low in your belly. By taking time to strengthen this muscle properly, you are creating a built-in “corset” for your body that holds the abs in tight and protects your low back.  Pilates is an example of a workout that can help you work your transverse abdominus. My favorite Pilates exercise to start with is a full body roll up.\nFinally, you should also target your obliques, which are your side abdominals. They help you bend side to side, rotate right and left, and stabilize and protect your spine. Your obliques have to work in harmony with all of your abdominal muscles to truly give you a tight tummy and a strong, stable back. Check out this Russian Twist exercise or side plank to work your obliques.\nNote: If you are pregnant, consult your doctor to decide if it’s safe for you to do ab exercises. If you  have recently given birth and have any abdominal wall separation, check out our 10 minute workout for Diastasis Recti to help you ease back into exercise.

Create a Calorie Deficit\nIt’s fairly straightforward: If you want to lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you take in. This is what is referred to as a “calorie deficit”.\nYou can reduce calories by lowering your calorie intake, increasing physical activity, or a combination of both.\nFor most people, a calorie deficit of 500 calories per day is sufficient for weight loss and unlikely to significantly affect your hunger or energy.\nHowever, it should be noted that women generally should not consume fewer than 1,200 calories per day, and men no fewer than 1,500 calories.\nA good tip to use when creating a calorie deficit with diet is to fill half of your plate with veggies—and the remaining parts with lean protein (salmon, chicken) and some healthy carbs (quinoa, rice.) This will help you with portion control.\nFor increasing physical activity, you’ll be more motivated if you pick something you like to do. I always suggest walking, especially for beginners, because most people are willing to try power walking. Power walking doesn’t require a trip to the gym or a lot of extra time – it can burn up to 200 or more calories per 30-minute walk. The key to walking for weight loss is to walk fast. Walk like you are in an airport and late for a flight.\nJust because these tips are simple, does not mean they are easy. Here are some tips to stay motivated during your weight loss journey.\n5. Increase Protein and Fiber Intake\nIn order to lose weight, including from your lower belly, you should consume an adequate amount of fiber and protein.\nFiber has a wide range of benefits, including aiding weight loss. Some types of fiber slow the absorption of nutrients, allowing you to feel full longer, therefore consuming less calories throughout the day and helping achieve a deficit.\nMen need between 30 and 38 grams of fiber per day, and women need between 21 and 25 grams per day.\nSome good sources of fiber include: avocados, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans.\nProtein is made up of amino acids and helps feed and repair our muscles, among other parts of our body. However, it’s where you are getting your protein that matters most.\nChoose good sources of animal protein, like fish, poultry, eggs and low-fat dairy. Vegetables also provide ample amounts of protein – look for dark, leafy greens like kale, spinach, broccoli and asparagus. And don’t forget quinoa, a grain that mimics the same amino acid profile as an animal protein.  A good choice for vegetarians and vegans.\n6. Limit Added Sugars and Refined Carbs\nIt’s true, you can’t out-exercise a bad diet. And you may not want to hear it, but limiting or better yet eliminating added sugars and refined carbohydrates is key to hitting your weight loss goals, including decreasing belly fat.\nAdded sugars like those in soda, juice, cookies, muffins, processed meals, and candy are the enemy. (Don’t be afraid of natural sugar found in foods like fruits, vegetables and dairy products, which contain healthy fiber and don’t affect your insulin in the same way.)\nAdded sugars increase your hunger and desire for more sugar, neither of which make weight loss easier. Also, drinking a lot of sugary beverages is linked to an increased amount of visceral fat, a kind of deep belly fat associated with conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\nRefined carbohydrates are typically found in processed, packaged foods like frozen pizza or food made with white flour like pasta and bagels. These carbs act just like added sugar in your body. Refined carbs release glucose (sugar) into your bloodstream much faster than complex carbs like quinoa, sweet potatoes and whole grains. This results in blood sugar spikes, which lead to crashes that can trigger hunger and cravings for more high-carb foods.\n\nRefined carbohydrate foods also usually lack essential nutrients and can be considered “empty” calories.\nNote: In addition to added sugars and refined carbs, alcohol also contributes to weight gain: it stops your body from burning fat, it’s high in calories, it can make you feel hungry, and it can lead to poor food choices. Remember to drink in moderation – women should have no more than one drink a day, and men should have no more than two per day.\n7. Drink More Water\nWater has plenty of benefits, several of which involve maintaining a healthy weight, reducing belly bloat, improving energy and reducing hunger.\nAnd consider this: in a living, moving body, skeletal muscle is more than 70 percent water. In order to put healthy muscle on your body, water is a necessity.\nOn average, you should be drinking at least 8-10 glasses of water a day. If you exercise regularly, add another glass or two to that.\n8. Minimize Stress Levels\nHigh cortisol (the stress hormone) levels have actually been linked to belly fat retention.\nAlthough it’s not necessarily the first step in reducing belly fat, chronic stress can definitely cause some people to hold on to more visceral fat.\nManage stress through meditation, yoga and self-care, and see if you notice a difference.\n9. Get 7-9 Hours of Sleep\nYou may not think of sleep as being connected to your weight loss journey, but research shows otherwise: study participants who were put on a sleep-deprived diet experienced a 55 percent reduction in fat loss compared to the well-rested participants.\nLack of sleep can also change your fat cells by disrupting your body’s ability to properly use insulin. Excess insulin can cause your body to store fat in the wrong places, which can cause weight gain and even diabetes.\nAdults should regularly get the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep to stay healthy, alert and energized.\n\n15-Minute Workout To Burn Lower Belly Fat\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nNow that you’ve learned the diet and lifestyle changes needed to reduce fat, here is the 15-minute workout that completes the picture.
