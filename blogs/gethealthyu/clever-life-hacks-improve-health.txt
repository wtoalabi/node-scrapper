"Life is already busy, messy, and filled with unexpected surprises. So why contribute to the chaos by making health harder than it has to be?\nHack your way to better health with these 25 clever fitness and kitchen tricks that will save you time, money, and a headache.\nUse these health hacks for weight loss, an energy boost, or simply to feel a little healthier every day.\n1. Kickstart your morning with lemon water\n\n\n\n\n\nStart every morning with a glass of water with fresh-squeezed lemon or lemon oil! (Just make sure it’s an edible, 100% natural-grade oil and not anything synthetic if you go the essential oil route.)\nThere are so many benefits of lemon water, but the main reasons to drink it are that it flushes your system of toxins, alkalizes your body, and keeps your digestive system working as it should.\nThis gives you more energy, fights off inflammation, and provides you with an all-natural health boost that’s easy peasy, lemon squeezy.\n2. Sweat it out before you hop in the shower\nYou know daily exercise is ideal, but some days it can feel like there’s NO extra time. Enter: the pre-shower sweat session.\nMake it a goal to “earn” your shower working up a sweat first with some lunges, push-ups, squats, and more. (Try any of these 10-Minute Workouts if you need some ideas!)\nAfter a few minutes you’ll have toned your muscles, energized yourself for the day, and maybe encouraged yourself to make exercise more of a habit during the rest of the week.\n3. Never eat a bad egg again\n\n\n\n\n\n(Photo Credit: Food-Hacks.WonderHowTo.com)\nYou’re not a bad egg; we think you’re great! But eating a bad egg? Not so great.\nTo test the freshness of those last few guys hanging around in the carton, drop ‘em in a bowl of water. Fresh eggs will sink, eggs perfect for hard-boiling will sink on their side, and bad eggs will float.\nSee the full egg explanation here.\n4. Meditate to clear your mind\nSetting aside as little as five minutes to meditate each day pays off big: those who commit to daily meditation are less stressed, sleep better, and have improved immune function over those who don’t.

Use baking soda as a natural produce scrub\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine a few teaspoons of baking soda to 1-2 cups of water and you have a natural produce scrub!
