"It’s strawberry season which means it’s time to liven up your typical dishes with these bright red and juicy gems. If you want sweet, tart, healthy and refreshing, you’re bound to stock up on them at the farmers’ market and beyond, but as you well know, with anything fresh comes an expiration date. Strawberries spoil even faster than bananas, which may cause you to panic once a day or two has gone by and you still haven’t used up your expensive bushel of fresh berries, but don’t worry! From how to prolong their freshness to how to incorporate them into a variety of dishes, we’ve got you covered.\nHow To Keep Berries Fresh\nWhite vinegar is a fresh berry’s best friend. Once you bring them home, it’s important to kill any spores on the fruit, so place them in a large bowl and wash with 1 cup of white vinegar and 8 cups of water. Let the berries sit in the bath, moving them around gently to dislodge any dirt, and allowing the vinegar to kill spores and bacteria. Next, drain the strawberries in a colander and rinse well. Dry by wrapping gently in a paper towel, then store in a sealed container lined with dry paper towels.\nRelated: 9 Hacks To Keep Your Food Fresh\nYou can also do a quick hot-water bath of 30 seconds in 125-degree water to kill bacteria, or opt for a produce cleaner, such as Rebel Green, that will elongate their life in the refrigerator.\nWays To Use Your Fresh Strawberries\n\nStrawberry Bruschetta\n\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: HappyHealthyMama.com\nTomatoes are typically the shining star of this Italian appetizer, but substituting strawberries will add a whole new refreshing tangy sweetness that simply screams summer.\n\nStrawberry Shortcake Oatmeal\n\nOatmeal is a breakfast favorite no matter the time of year, but given summer’s abundance of strawberries, it’s the perfect time to sweeten up your morning meal with this innovative, dessert-like recipe.\n\nStrawberry Spinach Salad with Chicken\n\nFruit in salads is a wonderful wakeup call for your palate when you’re simply getting bored of veggies-on-veggies.\n\nStrawberry Chocolate Chip Muffins\n\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: ChocolateCoveredKatie.com\nAre you a fan of chocolate covered strawberries?
