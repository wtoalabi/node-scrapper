It acts like a shock absorber supporting the arch in your foot.\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: www.Fasciitis.com\nIf tension on the fascia is overloaded, tiny tears are produced resulting in irritation, inflammation and pain. The pain might feel like a stabbing sensation in the heel or arch of the foot, or it might feel more like deep aching or throbbing.\nMost people feel this pain when getting out of bed in the morning. The pain generally subsides as the foot gets warmed up and moving.\nThis is because the fascia is contracted at night almost as if it tries to heal itself. When you step on it getting out of bed, a sudden strain occurs all over again.\nIf you have plantar fasciitis, you may be looking for exercises and stretches for relief and to help heal. And the sooner you start to treat plantar fasciitis the better since the longer you wait, the worse it typically gets and the longer it will take to heal.\n\nUse the links below to quickly navigate this guide:\n\nStretches For Plantar Fasciitis\nAdditional Plantar Fasciitis Treatments\nWorking Out With Plantar Fasciitis\nShoe Inserts For Plantar Fasciitis\n\n\nStretches for Plantar Fasciitis\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular and consistent stretching is going to be key for any plantar fasciitis treatment plan.\nSome simple plantar fasciitis stretches and strengthening exercises can help reduce plantar fasciitis pain. It is best to do each exercise not only daily, but in some cases several times a day.\nThe good news is they can be spread out throughout the day. Here’s a sample of how to easily work them into your daily routine. Make sure you do these for BOTH of your feet, even if you only have pain on one side.\nBefore You Get Out Of Bed\nHand Stretch & Massage\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you get out of bed, use your hands to gently pull the top of your foot back stretching it very lightly. Then take your thumbs and, starting in the middle of your foot pull each thumb toward the outer edges of the foot almost like you are trying to get rid of a wrinkle. Do this in 3 or 4 different places at the bottom of your foot.\nAlphabet Game\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, sit up in bed and hang your legs over the side to play the alphabet game with your foot. Point your big toe and draw the alphabet from A to Z with each foot to strengthen and stretch the foot and calf.\nRoll It Out\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the alphabet game, slowly stand up and place one foot on a massage ball, tennis ball, or frozen water bottle and slowly roll it across the bottom of the foot starting at the heel. Once you reach your toes go back slowly in the other direction. Repeat 3 times for each foot.\nChoosing a frozen water bottle gives you the bonus of reducing inflammation while the rolling massage helps you get prepared to step and move.\nBefore or After Lunch\nStep Stretch\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the nearest set of stairs and stand on the bottom step. Put the ball of the foot you want to stretch on the step and let the heel drop down for 30 seconds. Switch to the other foot and do the same. Stretch each foot 3 times.\nHeel Press\n\n\n\n\n\nStand facing a wall and place both hands against the wall. Step one foot back and press the heel of that foot firmly into the ground keeping your leg straight. Move your hips forward until you feel a stretch in your calf. Hold 30 seconds. Switch legs and repeat. Try 3 times per foot. Don’t bounce! Remember that tight calves are often the origin of heel pain.\nJust Before Bed\nWashcloth Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\nSit on a chair or the edge of your bed with a washcloth on the floor. Keep your heel on the ground and lift the washcloth with your toes. Release and repeat 10 times. Repeat on the other foot.\nSeated Straight Leg Stretch\n\n\n\n\n\nGrab a long band and or towel and sit down on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Place the band or towel around one foot, keeping that leg straight. Gently pull back on the band or towel holding for 30 seconds and breathing gently. Switch to the other floor. Stretch each side 3 times.\n\nAdditional Plantar Fasciitis Treatments\n\nIn addition to performing the above stretches for plantar fasciitis, you may want to add on some additional treatments.\nWhen plantar fasciitis is treated early, most people resolve their pain with conservative treatments within six weeks. However, sometimes it takes a few treatments stacked on top of one another.\nHere are some tried and true treatment options that can be utilized to relieve plantar fasciitis pain:\n\nIce\n\nJust like with other injuries, the inflammation of plantar fasciitis can be helped with ice. The best way to do this is to use a frozen water bottle and roll it back and forth under your foot for about 10 minutes, several times a day. Do it at meals, under your desk while you work or even at night when you watch TV. Be consistent.\n\nMassage\n\nNo, you don’t have to pay for it. While you are sitting, roll a tennis ball around under your foot to massage the area. It works like a foam roller for your foot. Of course, the frozen water bottle also serves this purpose.\n\nMedication\n\nOver the counter anti-inflammatories can help. Ibuprofen or Naproxin are good bets to reduce inflammation and provide pain relief.\n\nRest\n\nYour feet need time off from whatever is causing the issue. Stop or cut way back on high-impact exercises.\n\nGet new shoes\n\nWhat a great prescription, huh? Most people wear their workout shoes for far too long before replacing.\nRemember that the plantar fascia muscle, which runs along the bottom of your foot, helps support the arch of your foot. So it makes sense that if you do not wear shoes with proper support you are putting extra wear and tear on that fascia. This leads to the muscle being strained and small tears can be created.\nAlso, many find relief by wearing supportive shoes or shoe inserts (more on that below) very regularly. Keeping shoes on as much as possible allows the fascia to heal more quickly and maintain support.\n\nWorking Out with Plantar Fasciitis\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, is it okay to workout with plantar fasciitis? Yes!\nExercising with plantar fasciitis is, in general, something you can do. Just be aware that you may have to adjust your workouts until the problem is resolved and even then, make sure you resume your regular activities slowly.\nThere are two things to remember when you decide to workout with plantar fasciitis.\n\nIt is critically important to wear proper, supportive shoes at all times! Even if you participate in water aerobics, there are shoes for you and you need to have them on!\nParticipate only in things that will not contribute to the heel strike or pounding of your feet. Here are some suggestions.\n\nWorkouts To Try With Plantar Fasciitis:\nThese workouts are typically low impact: meaning they reduce the amount of impact that your foot will have to absorb.\n\nSwimming\nWater Aerobics\nElliptical Machine\nWeight Lifting\nCycling with hard surface shoes\nRowing Machine\nYoga\nMat Pilates\n\nWorkouts To Avoid With Plantar Fasciitis:\n\nThese workouts are typically high impact: meaning the amount of impact your foot will have to absorb is not recommended when dealing with plantar fasciitis.\n\nRunning\nJumping\nBouncing\nStep Aerobics\nWalking for fitness\nGoing barefoot or wearing flip-flops (use shoes even in your home!)\n\n\nShoe Inserts For Plantar Fasciitis\n\n\n\n\n\nCheap or improper shoes can be one of the causes of plantar fasciitis, but before you go buying brand new shoes, you may also consider shoe inserts. Inserts last longer and can be moved from shoe to shoe as needed.\nHere are some things to keep in mind when looking for shoe inserts:\n\nLook for insoles that have been well-tested and recommended by other users. If you don’t know someone personally, read the reviews online.\nTake time to know your own feet before you buy. Neutral? Pronator? Supinator? Get a diagnosis from a medical professional or a specialized running store that uses a treadmill to watch you and help you understand your gait.\nLook for inserts with deep heel cups. Generally, those who experience plantar fasciitis need more support in the arches of the feet. A deeper heel cup will provide this. Do you have flat feet? Low Arches? Moderate arches? If you aren’t sure, Runner’s World provides you with the Wet Feet Test that you can do at home to determine the amount of arch support you will need.\nGive the inserts time to break in. Just like a new pair of shoes, the inserts will change the foot movement and your feet will need time to adjust. Do it in small doses.\n\nHere are a few of our favorite options to help you get started:\nSuperfeet Black Premium Insoles\n\n\n\n<br />\n\nCustom designed for low-medium arch foot types they are considered one of the best on the market for flat feel. Other Superfeet Insoles fit different foot shapes. The Superfeet Blue, for more of a medium arch, is one of the best sellers out there.\n\n\n\nPowerstep Protech Orthotic Supports\n\n\n\n\nPlantar Fasciitis sufferers have chosen these for a long time reporting great results. These have a deep heel cup, dual layers for better shock absorption, and anti-microbial protection for freshness.\n\n\n\nPowerstep Unisex Pinnacle Maxx Insole\n\n\n\n<br />\n\nIf you are a severe pronator this is a great choice for you. The Powerstep has a slightly angled exterior heel platform to provide motion control. These are also anti-microbial.\n\n\n\nGEL Orthotic Shoe Gel Insoles\n\n\n\n\nLike shock absorbers for your car, these babies have a cushy gel material for gentle relief. One thing to consider: these come oversized for you to trim to fit your size rather than coming in a specific size set to your foot. This turns some people off.\n\n\n\nAirplus Plantar Fasciitis Orthotic\n\n\n\n\nHere is another choice with gel insert cushions. These also have the deep heel cup we recommend. Those who reviewed the Syono often noted they provide more stability than other more notable name brands they have tried.\n\n\n\n \nStretching, avoiding high-impact workouts and using the proper foot support all play a role in solving plantar fasciitis pain.\nBe sure to see your doctor if the pain persists for more than three to four weeks with conservative treatments.\nBest of luck and remember that slowing down now will help you continue to move for many years to come!\n\nREAD THIS NEXT: 7 Workout Mistakes That Can Leave You In Pain \n\nBest Stretches for Plantar Fasciitis Relief"
