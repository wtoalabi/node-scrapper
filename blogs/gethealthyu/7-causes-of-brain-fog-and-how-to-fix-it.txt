"When you don’t feel as mentally sharp as you normally do, it can be upsetting. Brain fog—or the feeling of being mentally confused and unfocused—can be a distressing sensation.\nThe truth is, brain fog can be a symptom of many different medical conditions, most of them innocuous and short-lasting.\nRead on to discover what brain fog is, seven common causes of brain fog, and how to get rid of brain fog and get back to feeling like yourself.\nWhat Is Brain Fog?\nBrain fog is also referred to as “brain fatigue.” It can range from a mild to severe experience of mental confusion.\nYou may have trouble remembering things mid-sentence, find your mind trailing off, or feel a “cloud of consciousness” as it has also been called.\nBut brain fog isn’t solely a feeling of losing your mental sharpness. Other symptoms of brain fog include:\n\ndifficulty concentrating\nheadaches\nforgetfulness\nlow energy or motivation\nconfusion\nirritability\ntrouble sleeping through the night\n\nIs Brain Fog the Same As Dementia? \n\n\n\n\n\nNo. Just because you’re experiencing a bout of brain fog doesn’t mean you need to leap to conclusions.\nAccording to rheumatologist Robert Lahita, MD, PhD, who spoke with Prevention, “impermanence is the big difference between what we know as brain fog and actual dementia.”\nBrain fog may last a few days or weeks, or come and go as the underlying cause gets sorted out, but dementia is much more severe and will continue to eventually progress.\nAlways speak with your doctor about how you’re feeling, but be careful not to jump to conclusions as we’re about to see there are many different things that can cause episodes of brain fog in the first place.\nWhat Causes Brain Fog?\nSince brain fog is a symptom and not a condition itself, where, exactly, is it coming from? If you’re experiencing brain fog it could be due to one of these common causes.\nRemember to always check in with your doctor if you think testing or diagnostics are required.\n1. Menopause\nYes, with all the other joys of this glorious time of life, menopause can also bring bouts of brain fog. Scour the internet for memes and you’ll find plenty that poke fun at the forgetfulness that often comes with your menopausal years.\nThis is all thanks to—what else —fluctuating hormones in your body. Specifically, a decrease in estrogen.\nStudies have confirmed that women’s performance on certain memory tasks decline during their menopausal years. But don’t worry: as your hormones even out, your brain fog likely will as well.\nResearch also shows that memory usually improves in post-menopausal years.\nRelated: How To Deal With The 10 Most Common Menopause Symptoms \nYour menopausal years may come with ups and downs, but you can do things to help ease uncomfortable symptoms like brain fog. Studies show that consistent exercise can help you feel more mentally sharp and reduce the frequency of brain fog.\n2. Diabetes\nPeople with diabetes can often experience periods of brain fog due to fluctuating glucose.\nSince glucose is the primary energy source for your brain, fluctuating levels in diabetics can cause short-term brain fog.\nWhether you have type 1 or type 2 Diabetes, if you’re experiencing mental confusion or periods of brain fatigue, speak with your doctors about different ways to manage your Diabetes.\n3. Lack of Sleep\nIt should come as no surprise that when you’re sleep deprived, you’re a bit foggy. Your brain needs 7-8 hours of sleep per night to function at its best.\nEspecially when you experience chronic, long-term sleep deprivation, brain fog and feeling a bit fuzzy are to be expected.\nTry re-setting your natural body clock by going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, and keeping a lavender aromatherapy diffuser by your bed to help induce sleep.\n4. Nutritional Deficiencies\nYour brain fog could be from a vitamin B12 deficiency.\nB12 is extremely important for the health of your brain and nervous symptom. If you suffer from digestive woes and often take medications like zantac or Pepcid, you may be particularly prone to having a B12 deficiency, too.\nTo correct it, either take a B12 supplement and/or try incorporating more of the following foods which are high in B12 into your diet:\n\nSeafood: salmon, shrimp, mackerel, sardines, trout, herring\nGrass-fed beef\nEggs \nFortified yeast\n\n5. Side Effects of Medications\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain fog can be a side effect of many common medications.\nEven if it isn’t listed as a symptom of your medication, if you notice that your brain fog has only come about when you’ve started a new medication, talk to your doctor.\nEverybody is different, and the way you metabolize or handle medication can affect your mental state.\n6. Neurological Disorders\nAside from things like lack of sleep or nutritional deficiencies, there are specific disorders that can cause brain fog. Conditions like lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and more often cause brain fog.\nIf you’ve ruled out other potential causes and can’t seem to get to the bottom of things, make an appointment with your doctor to make sure one of these disorders isn’t to blame.\n7. Depression or Anxiety\nIf you’re suffering from depression or anxiety, you may also experience brain fog.\nBecause of the mental energy it takes to be in a constant state of stress, worry, or depression, these conditions can naturally make you may feel more confused, listless, or mentally drained.\nTalk with a doctor and/or psychologist to manage underlying mental health conditions, and you’ll likely feel your brain fog lift as well.\nHow To Get Rid Of Brain Fog \nAfter identifying one of the possible causes above, it’s important to treat the underlying issue that’s causing your brain fog.
