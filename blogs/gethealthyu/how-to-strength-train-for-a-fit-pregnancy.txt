"“Fit” and “pregnant” aren’t normally words you put together, but trust us: they’ve become a perfect pair. Gone are the days of treating an expectant mama like a fragile doll who might go into labor if she moves too quickly. These days, women are learning the benefits of a fit pregnancy; namely, healthier moms and babies. Prenatal exercise not only helps you keep off excess weight during and after your pregnancy, but also helps with your energy, mood, sleep and so much more. And while walking, swimming and other low impact forms of cardio are great for your energy and health, strength training is a crucial part of keeping your body fit and preparing you for motherhood.\nWhy Should I Strength Train During Pregnancy?\nLet’s face it, carrying a baby is hard work and giving birth is a colossal challenge. But taking care of a small human in addition to everything else you already do in your life? Now that’s a superhuman task. The good news is that you’ll be more prepared than ever if you continue to strength train throughout your pregnancy. According to the ACOG (American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), strength training during pregnancy has been shown to:\n\nReduce backaches and constipation\nReduce bloating and swelling\nHelp prevent and treat gestational diabetes\nImprove your posture\nIncrease your energy and mood\nPromote muscle tone, strength and endurance\nPromote better sleep\nFacilitate easier labor and quicker recovery\nHelp you get back to your old body more quickly\n\nSo lets recap:\n\nYour pregnancy is better if you strength train.\nYour birth experience is better if you strength train.\nYour post-birth experience is better if you strength train.\n\nSeems like a no-brainer, doesn’t it? Except one thing—what about the baby? All of these health benefits seem to help the mom, but is strength training okay for baby too?\n\n\n\n\nhttp://go.gethealthyutv.com/A12233/\nIs Exercise During Pregnancy Good For My Baby?\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course for most moms the first concerns are about her baby, not herself. So it will warm your heart to know that regular prenatal exercise benefits baby as well! From healthier brains to proper birth weight and even the health of the baby’s blood vessels, the baby benefits just as much from the exercise mom does while pregnant. In fact, science even suggests that prenatal exercise benefits your baby’s heart health.\nRelated: 20-Minute Prenatal Cardio Workout\nIs Prenatal Exercise OK For Me?\nIf you have a normal, healthy pregnancy you will likely be allowed—and even encouraged—to exercise.
