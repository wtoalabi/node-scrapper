"Balance exercises for seniors are a big deal. Better balance gives you the confidence to be successful with a lot of your daily activities.  If you’ve heard me say it once you’ve heard me say it 1000 times: you are never too late, you are never too old to start improving your health. And a big part of a healthy lifestyle as we age into our senior years is good balance.    \n\n\n\nI talk often about the many reasons to exercise: building muscle, conditioning your heart, increasing metabolism, and improving energy are on that list. Also on that list – regaining balance. \n\n\n\nAs we age, balance plays a part in everyday movement. Picking things up, bending down, getting out of a chair, reaching, twisting – all these things require balance. At the end of the day balance is a big part of graceful aging and being independent.  \n\n\n\nWhat’s in this article:\n\n\n\n\nThe Benefits of Balance for Seniors\nWhy Seniors Lose Balance\nWhat is Balance\nSensory Components of Balance\nHow Seniors Can Assess Their Balance\nWhat Seniors Can Do to Improve Their Balance\nBalance Exercises for Seniors (Jump Straight to the Workout)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Benefits of Balance Exercises for Seniors\n\n\n\nBalance is one of those things where you might not realize the importance of it until you start to lose it. And for most of us, this loss comes with old age. \nFor some seniors, poor balance and falling can stem from medical issues that they have no control of. According to the American Council on Exercise, one in five older adults has issues with balance.\n\n\n\nBut for a good majority of these folks, it is simply a matter of losing their strength and the natural ability to move the way they did when they were younger because they simply don’t do it anymore. And it only takes one fall to take a senior off their feet for weeks or months or possibly remove their  independence completely.\n\n\n\nAnd in case you don’t think you need to take it all that seriously, consider that falls are the leading cause of death from injury among people 65 and older. According to the National Council on Aging falling is NOT an inevitable result of aging. That’s right – you can do your part now to help prevent falling later. \n\n\n\nBenefits of balance as you age include:\n\n\n\n\nIncreased reaction time which is good for fall prevention. This is important because one of the easiest ways to stop yourself mid-fall is by quickly shifting your weight or gripping onto an object nearby. \nImproved mobility.\nBetter body awareness which means awareness of your body in space. \nMore independence and self-sufficiency. You’ll have more confidence and a reduced risk of injury. \nImproved coordination.\nStronger bones and muscles.  It is well-documented that exercise helps to build muscle and strengthen bones. Strong bones are more resistant to fractures and reduce the risk for osteoporosis.\nBetter vision. Regular exercise can help maintain better eye health and will improve your ability to avoid obstacles that could cause you to fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Seniors Lose Balance\n\n\n\nAs a natural part of aging, balance is hindered by factors such as joint degeneration and muscle loss.  Weaker core muscles and even changes in eyesight can cause seniors to lose balance more often.\n\n\n\nLoss of balance is not inevitable as you age. You do not have to accept it as a given. \n\n\n\nRelated: 5 Core Exercises for Seniors\n\n\n\nThe good news is that there are countless ways to improve your balance. Some things are super simple that you can incorporate into your everyday life.\n\n\n\nWhat is Balance\n\n\n\nThink of it this way: just like you shouldn’t wait until you are 65 to start thinking about saving money for retirement, you also shouldn’t wait until you are older to prepare your body for the strength and balance you will need to stay independent and strong for as long as possible! \n\n\n\nBalance is the ability to maintain your body’s stability in space.\n\n\n\nBalance is determined by sensory input from our inner ear and eyes as well as motor feedback from muscles that control the movement of our limbs. Our core muscles are a big part of this. The better we become at processing these signals, the more quickly we can react to keep ourselves balanced.\n\n\n\nThe Sensory Components of Balance\n\n\n\nIn order to maintain balance, three senses are used.\n\n\n\n\nEyes. Your vision offers clues that help you maintain your balance and steer clear of obstacles.\nNerves. Your body has nerve receptors in the canals of your inner ear that send messages to your brain when your head moves in any direction.\nMuscles and tendons. The third contributor to good balance is proprioceptors, which tell your brain when you are moving so you know how much muscle shift is necessary to maintain equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\nHow Seniors Can Assess Their Balance\n\n\n\nThese are a few tips for seniors to see where their balance is at currently. It’s important to understand your level of balance first before you get started with any type of stretching, balance or exercise routine.\n\n\n\n\nDetermine which leg is your dominant side. Be aware of it as you practice balance. It is normal to have one side be stronger and it’s good to recognize and work on that non-dominant side. \nAssess your posture. Often posture can play a major role in overall balance and stability.\nAssess your core muscles.  They play a huge part in your ability to balance.  Learning to engage the core muscles and working on strengthening them will be key to your success.  \nGaze at a fixed point on the wall. Finding a focal point when performing exercises can make it easier to balance. \nKeep your knees slightly bent. This will lower your center of gravity and will prevent your knees from buckling and make you more stable overall.\nSpread your weight evenly across both feet. Wider base, better balance. \n\n\n\n\nWhat Seniors Can Do to Improve Balance\n\n\n\n\nStand on one foot from time to time during the day. (hold onto a counter or something if needed.) \nSit on an exercise ball at your desk instead of a chair\nSquat one inch over a chair and hold for a few seconds before sitting down. \nWalk with a book on your head. (Old school but effective!)\nTake yoga classes!\nStand still with your eyes closed. Pick up a foot, count to 10 then switch. (This is advanced.) \nTry the Bosu balance ball and/or stability ball to take it up a notch!\n\n\n\n\nBest Balance Exercises for Seniors\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nImproving balance can start with these simple everyday tips.
