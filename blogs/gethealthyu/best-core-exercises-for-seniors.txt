"Ab workouts aren’t limited to athletes and the under-30 crowd. As a matter of fact, seniors rank as one of the top groups who should be doing core strengthening exercises on a regular basis, because targeting your midsection with exercises that sculpt and strengthen is key for staying healthy and active. \n\n\n\nFact is, exercise and everyday living get harder as you age. And if you want to keep up your running or tennis habit, play with your grandkids, and generally be able to do things for yourself, you have to keep your body in good shape. A weak core can get in the way of those activities. Adding core strengthening exercises for seniors into your weekly routine is a great way to make this happen.\n\n\n\nThat said, rushing through some sit-ups won’t do the trick. You need a variety of core strengthening exercises to ensure you hit every inch of your midsection.\n\n\n\nTo help you get that core strength back, this article covers the most effective core exercises for seniors, along with recommendations for incorporating them into your week. But first, we’ll review some key facts about core strength, and the many benefits of core strengthening exercises for older adults.  \n\n\n\nWhat’s Your “Core”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: http://www.jointventurespt.com/\n\n\n\nThe “core” is more than just the visible ab muscles you see on display in popular fitness magazines. It’s made up of all the muscles in your trunk, which assist in nearly every movement you make. Key core muscles include:\n\n\n\nGlutes: The meaty muscle in your buttocks is called the gluteus maximus, and it helps propel you from seated to standing, power up a flight of stairs, and walk around the block. You also have the gluteus medius, which is a smaller muscle on either side of your buttocks that helps keep you steady while you stand, walk, or jog.\n\n\n\nRectus abdominis: The rectus abdominis is the main “six-pack” muscle that runs from your rib cage to your pubic bone. It primarily works to flex, or bend your trunk.\n\n\n\nObliques: The obliques are made up of a pair of external oblique muscles — one on each side of your trunk — and a pair of internal oblique muscles, which are located just below the external obliques. Together, these muscles twist and bend your trunk from side to side.\n\n\n\nTransverse abdominis: The transverse abdominis is your deepest ab muscle. It helps with breathing and works to stabilize your pelvis and low back.\n\n\n\nYou also have a handful of lesser-known core muscles that support your spine and help you perform daily activities. These include the multifidus and erector spinae, which bend and straighten the spine and keep it stable during activity, as well as the psoas, which connect your legs to your trunk and help bend your hips. These core exercises for seniors will target all of these muscle groups.\n\n\n\nRelated: How To Get In Shape Over 50\n\n\n\nBenefits of Core Strength for Older Adults\n\n\n\nA few key benefits of core exercises for seniors include:\n\n\n\nImproves Posture and Reduces Back Pain\n\n\n\nWhether you’re moving or sitting still, your core muscles are in charge of keeping you upright. When these muscles are weak, we tend to slouch, causing back discomfort and pain. \n\n\n\nImproving your core strength will keep your trunk upright and slouching at a minimum, which eases back pain over time.  \n\n\n\nHelps With Everyday Activities\n\n\n\nStrong core abdominal muscles make it easier to do the daily activities many of us take for granted, like walking up and down stairs, bending down to tie your shoes, and getting out of bed in the morning. If you enjoy sports, core strength will help you swing a golf club, run a 5K, and swim laps more easily.\n\n\n\nImproves Balance and Coordination\n\n\n\nMany of your core abdominal muscles work to keep you stable while sitting, standing, and walking. When these muscles are strong and healthy, they’re better able to do this all-important job, which allows you to maintain balance and coordination without much thought.   \n\n\n\nThe 8 Best Core Exercises for Seniors\n\n\n\nThe following moves are some of the top core exercises for older adults. Aim to do these exercises daily to keep your core muscles strong and healthy. Perform each move for 5-10 reps (per side) and you’ll get a great core workout in less than 10 minutes. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
