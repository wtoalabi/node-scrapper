"Whether you’ve overindulged in a big meal, are dealing with constipation, or suffer from a chronic issue like Irritable Bowel Disease, digestive discomfort is never fun. Bloating, gas, and abdominal cramps can be unpleasant, inconvenient, and downright painful.

We’re sharing our favorite yoga poses for digestion.\nYoga for Digestion: How Does Yoga Help?\nYoga not only stretches your muscles, but helps detoxify the body, massage your internal organs, and, er, “get things moving again” so to speak by stimulating the body.\nNot only that, but yoga helps to relieve any mental stress that may be impacting your physical health.
