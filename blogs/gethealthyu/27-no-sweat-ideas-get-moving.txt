"I hear you. You don’t have time to workout every day.  Life is busy and I get it. Listen, I don’t workout every day. I do take an occasional rest day, but I’m always conscious to move whenever I get the opportunity.  No, every workout does not have to be a sweat session. Simply telling yourself to move more can be life changing.  After all, your desk chair or your couch may be your biggest health hazzard. People will tell me they think the whole “park farther away in the parking lot” tip is silly.  But I’m here to tell you that it’s all about the sum of the parts.  Active people tend to burn more calories, feel better and are even happier! And all of those small decisions, like walking across a parking lot to enter the store–add up!  You all know I’m a lover of intense workouts, but one hour a day of exercise does not grant you the privilege to sit  on your butt for the next 16 hours.\nExcessive sitting impacts our body’s metabolic system: “Today, our bodies are breaking down from obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, depression and the cascade of health ills and everyday malaise that come from what scientists have named sitting disease.” ~ James Levine, MD, PhD\nSo we’ve complied 27 ways to sneak more movement into your day:\nAT HOME:\n\nStand up and march during the commercials when watching your TV shows.\nTake each family members laundry upstairs separately.\nWhen talking on the phone to a friend, pace the floor, walk around the room, your house or your yard.\nDo yard work: Rake leaves, shovel snow, mow the lawn.\nStart your day with 16 squats, 16 alternating lunges and 16 pushups.\nInstead of sitting to read your book, buy it on your smartphone and walk on the treadmill or around your neighborhood while listening.\nTurn on tunes and get your dance on while cleaning.\n\nAT WORK:\n\n Drink tons of water – you’ll have to get up and go to the bathroom more often.\nGet a standing workstation. (Or make a DIY).\nSit on a stability ball.  Do a few ab crunches several times a day.\nTake the stairs up to your office and back down at the end of the day.\nSchedule moving meetings.\nSet an alarm on your computer and get up once an hour to take a lap around the office.\nGet a co-worker to be your workout buddy for the lunch hour.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tA one hour workout does not grant you permission to sit on your butt the rest of the day.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tClick to Tweet\n\t\t\nWHILE TRAVELING:\n\nWhen you’re waiting for a flight, don’t just sit in a chair, take a walk around the airport.\nSkip the people movers.\nStand while waiting for a train.\nWhen stopping for a road-trip break, take a quick lap around the parking lot.\nGet off the bus two stops sooner; walk the rest of the way.\nBook hotel rooms on a high floor and walk up instead of the elevator.\n\n\n\n\n\n27 No Sweat Ideas to Get Moving\nWITH THE FAMILY:\n\nPlan active dates with your S.O. instead of always going out to eat.  Walk, bike, hike, do yoga together.\nBreak out the active video games with your kids.  Try the wii or the xbox and have fun.\nGet out in the yard with the family and play Frisbee, croquet, bocce ball.
