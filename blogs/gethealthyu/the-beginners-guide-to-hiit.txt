It’s not hype! HIIT exercises work.\nResearch shows that shorter, high-intensity workouts can do more for your health than longer, more leisurely workouts. HIIT also helps burn more fat at a faster rate.\nYou can improve your heart health and significantly reduce your risk for metabolic syndrome, as well as obesity, high triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure and high blood sugar.\nThese high-intensity workouts can be done in 30-minutes or less, and they’re stinkin’ fun.

This kind of exercise gets your heart rate up and improves your cardiovascular fitness level while burning more fat and calories in less time.\nHIIT: A Go-To Solution for Lack of Time\nWhat I always say is: Work smarter, not longer. With HIIT, you don’t have to carve out two hours for a workout—you can get an effective heart-pumping workout that combines cardio and strength training into just 10, 20 or 30-minutes.\n\nHIIT Exercises For Beginners\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want the ease of doing HIIT exercises at home, you’re in the right place.

The high-intensity part of HIIT involves giving it your all for a certain amount of seconds (duration can vary).\nWho is HIIT for?\nHIIT can be for all types of fitness levels and abilities; you just may not use all your effort when you first start.\nHIIT helps people significantly improve their cardiovascular fitness, endurance, and fat loss without losing the muscle mass they already have. If you want to try something new, want more from your workout or are a diehard fitness enthusiast, HIIT is for you.\nNonetheless, if you’re just starting a workout routine or have been sidelined for some time due to injury or life, the key to success lies in doing the moves with modifications at your own pace.\nHIIT should be intense, but pushing too hard too quickly can result in injuries and other setbacks.\nMy suggestions: listen to your body, use modifications where necessary, choose good form over speed and ease into how many HIIT workouts you do a week.\nRelated: 12-Minute HIIT Workout For Bad Knees\nHow often should I do HIIT?\nIf you are new to HIIT, just try one workout per week. If you are accustomed to working out, you can do HIIT three to five times max per week.\nHow many calories do HIIT workouts burn?\nAbout ten calories per minute! (But wear a heart rate monitor for exact feedback.)\nSince HIIT workouts rev up your metabolism, you will continue to torch those calories long after you have finished your HIIT workout!\nSafety Tips for HIIT Workouts\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the increased intensity, you can cause more wear and tear on your body, so make sure you follow these HIIT safety tips:\n\nAlways warm up and cool down for at least five minutes before and after your HIIT workouts.\nTake time to recover from your HIIT workouts. Take at least one to two days off per week from HIIT workouts.\nDon’t push yourself if you are already sore.\nStart slowly and build your endurance and ability.\nChoose to do the modifications of movements that are too challenging for you.\nIf you ever experience chest pain or difficulty breathing during your HIIT workouts, start to cool down.\nDon’t stop completely because your blood can pool in your extremities and cause lightheadedness, just stop the intensity and cool down slowly.\n\nBelly Blaster HIIT Workout\nNow let’s try some HIIT! If you are new to HIIT, watch your heart rate, stop when you need to, and don’t do the plyometrics (or jumping movements) just yet.\nIdeally, you should be able to exercise for 20 minutes without any issues before trying a HIIT workout.\nWorking out with high intensity intervals—short periods of time where your heart rate really gets up there and you find yourself panting through your mouth and needing recovery —shakes up your metabolism and forces your body to go into sugar and fat stores to find the necessary energy to not only get through the interval, but also for several hours following the workout.\nIn other words, in order for your body to come back to its normal place (“homeostasis”), it requires extra time and extra oxygen which leads to extra fat burn. It’s that simple. This workout will provide you with great ideas for these kind of intervals. All you have to do is work hard enough to make them effective.\nStrengthening The Transverse Abdominus (The “TVA”)\nHIIT can be fantastic for losing belly fat because it helps to strengthen the transverse abdominus. And while spot reducing is a myth, when you strengthen the TVA, your core looks all-around slimmer!\nThe transverse abdominus is the muscle that sits deep and low in your belly. By taking time to strengthen this muscle properly, you are creating a built-in “corset” for your body that holds the abs in tight and protects your low back. \nThis workout will give you some great belly fat blasting moves to strengthen your TVA mixed in with some cardio moves for that extra high intensity boost.\n\nTry this Belly Fat Blasting HIIT Workout \nRemember, the key to your results is dependent on your effort. For each exercise you will go hard for 20 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds before going to the next move. Repeat the entire sequence again for a total of 8 intervals.\nBLOCK 1 [20 seconds each/10 seconds in between. Repeat 2x]\n1.
