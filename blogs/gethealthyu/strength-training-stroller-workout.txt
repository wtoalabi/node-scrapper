"The balance between motherhood and, well, pretty much everything else, is difficult! That includes finding time for a quality exercise and strength training! You know you should, but when? Your baby needs your time too – and quite frankly, spending time with your babe is way more fun than sweating it out in the weight room. So what if you could do both? This 30-minute stroller strength workout offers both fat burning cardio with a power stroller walk and short stops along the way for bodyweight strength training. All you need is a stroller and some great shoes and suddenly your walk in the park is doing double-duty!\nHere’s the workout plan:\n\nPut on your comfy running/walking shoes and secure your baby in the stroller. A watch or a timer on your phone will help keep you on track.\nThis workout will take you on a power walk with stops along the way for strength training.
