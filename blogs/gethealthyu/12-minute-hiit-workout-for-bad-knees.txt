"So you want to do some high intensity interval training (HIIT) but your knees are in rough shape? Many people wonder, can you do HIIT with bad knees? Don’t sweat, you can do low impact HIIT that won’t aggravate knee pain. High intensity does not have to mean jumping.  You can be high intensity but perform low impact exercises. \nHIIT workouts encourage you to work hard during the work segment and then take a break to quickly recover during the rest segment. So, even if you can’t jump or do deep squats and lunges, this low impact HIIT workout for bad knees (below) will still help you reap the benefits that high intensity interval training provides, such as:\n\n\n\nA higher rate of fat burn both during and after the workout.\nBuilding your cardiovascular endurance.\nRaising your metabolic rate.\nWorking smarter not longer. \n\n\n\nWhat is Low Impact Exercise?  \nBefore you do the workout, make sure you understand what low impact is. Simply put it means no jumping.  It’s “less impact” on the joints.  \nAs I mentioned earlier, impact and intensity are two different things. Impact is about the force exerted on or by the body. When both feet leave the ground at the same time (jumping) that is high impact.  When you keep at least one foot on the ground, that is low impact.   \nIs Low Impact HIIT Effective? \nThe concept for HIIT is intensity involving mindset: go hard during the work, then take a rest and do it again.  \nWhile it is true that a HIIT workout often uses lower-body plyometrics and other high-impact exercises to raise your heart rate to anaerobic places, you can still raise your heart rate and tax your muscles while doing low impact HIIT.  I always remind my clients and students that YOU bring the attitude and effort to every workout.  The key to low impact exercise is staying focused and trying hard!  In order to increase heart rate and muscle engagement during low impact HIIT, the workout should: \n\nEngaging more muscle groups at a time.\nEncourage you to pick up speed during the low-impact exercises (but only once you’ve mastered good form and range of motion)! \nAdd in some sort of outside resistance like dumbbells! Using moderate to heavy dumbbells will allow you to keep your feet on the ground (aka low impact) but provide an extra challenge.\n\nWhat exercises should I avoid with bad knees?\nDepending on why your knees hurt will make a difference.  If you had a previous injury or surgery, your doctor may provide you with dos and don’ts for range of motion.  But if your knees hurt because you are overweight and deconditioned, you then need to start slowly with exercise, keep it low impact, and ease into more range of motion over time.  Your joints and muscles need to acclimate to exercise and overdoing it at first may leave you sore and feeling defeated.  Take baby steps with increasing your activity level and stay low impact.   \nTry this Low Impact HIIT workout for Bad knees\nThis workout was designed using moves that are protective of bad knees, some of which include holding dumbbells to give you that extra push of high intensity.
