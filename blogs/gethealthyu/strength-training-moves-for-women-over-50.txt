"While aging is inevitable, aging well is not. There are many factors involved in maintaining good physical and mental health as you age, but one of the most important things to consider as you grow older is weight training. \n\n\n\nExercise not only keeps you feeling and looking younger but actually physically slows down the aging process. And while exercise comes in many forms, strength training is where the true anti-aging magic happens. Strength training is one of the best types of exercises for women over 50 – it’s time to start! \n\n\n\nLet’s explore in detail the benefits of strength training and some of the specific strength training exercises women over 50 should do. \n\n\n\nWeight Training for Women Over 50 Program Guide\n\n\n\n\nBenefits Of Weight Training for Women over 50\n11 Strength Training Exercises Women Over 50 Should Do \nAdditional Strength Training Tips Before You Get Started \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Is It Important to Strength Train After 50? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe important benefits of weight training for women over 50:\n\n\n\nBuilds Muscle Mass:  As we get older, our bodies inevitably go through muscle loss, if we’re not focused on a strength training workout regularly. Those who strength train see tighter, more toned bodies, rather than getting “bulky”. Being stronger means you are able to stay independent and strong for life’s daily activities such as carrying groceries, lifting grandchildren, or engaging in fun activities like golf or other sports. \n\n\n\nAround the age of 30, we start to lose our muscle mass if not doing anything to actively replace it. As many women age, they become more sedentary and hence, their muscles start to deteriorate. That’s why you need to start doing strength work. \n\n\n\nBuilds Bone Density:  Muscle loss can have further consequences to bone health. Unexpected falls put countless older people in the hospital every year. In fact, according to the CDC, falls are the leading cause of injury and death in older Americans. By strength training the muscle and connective tissue that surrounds your bones, you are making yourself stronger and helping to prevent a fall from happening in the first place. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreases Body Fat: Maintaining a healthy weight is important when it comes to preventing many diseases that come with aging. By strength training, you are able to decrease the amount of body fat, both internally and externally. \n\n\n\nA healthy amount of fat is both good and necessary. Too much, however, is not. Strength training exercises can help with this. \n\n\n\nWeight Training Speeds Up Metabolism: Strength training and lifting weights leads to more muscle mass, which then leads to a  higher metabolism. Muscle uses more calories at a resting heart rate than body fat.  \n\n\n\nWhen you have more muscle mass on your body, you burn more calories every day. Why is probably why you want to get started asap!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproves Mental Health: Strength training is not just about more muscle mass. As you get older, you may go through a lot of life changes making it normal to feel sad, stressed, or uneasy about these changes. Adopting a strength training program has been shown to improve your confidence and boost your mental health. Harvard Medical School reports that exercise helps lessen the incidence and the degree of clinical depression. \n\n\n\nImproves Balance, Coordination, and Mobility: As you age, you tend to lose the overall muscle strength that allows you to balance. By lifting weights, you are not only building up muscle strength and protecting bone health, you are also forcing your body to function in an unbalanced state, thus improving overall balance and coordination. \n\n\n\nReduces Risk of Many Diseases: According to Tufts University, strength training exercise will reduce the risks and symptoms of several health problems too including: arthritis, diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, back pain and depression.\n\n\n\nRelated: How to Regain Flexibility Over 50 \n\n\n\n11 Best Strength Training Exercises for Women Over 50\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nHere are 11 exercises for women over 50 that will work every muscle group and give you a good total body workout.

This goes for anyone in their 30s and all the way up into your 50s, 60s, and even 70s! Strength training is perfectly safe for women over 50, but there are a few tips you should know before getting started: \n\n\n\n\nConsult your doctor before dramatically changing your exercise regimen or if you have any pre-existing conditions or injuries. \n\nStart Slow & Small\n\nWondering how often a 50-year-old woman should lift weights? Start with baby steps. Let your body adapt to the strength training exercises. If you haven’t been strength training for a while or ever, you need to let your joints, muscle and tissues get used to your increased activity.  \nSimply starting with one to two sessions of weight training per week can have major benefits for your bone health and muscle mass.\n\nDrink Water!\n\nDrink a lot of water! This should be before, during, and after. \n\nAlways Warm Up\n\nAlways start your weight training session with a dynamic warm-up. The older you are, the more warming up you will need. \nGet some range of motion happening in the joints, start breathing through your mouth and get your blood pumping. \n\nListen to Your Body\n\nThe “No Pain, No Gain” mentality does not apply during strength training. Muscle fatigue is good. Muscle pain is not. If something hurts and does not feel good, you should stop. Do not keep pushing through! \n\nCool Down and Stretch\n\nAlways end your strength workout with a cool-down or stretch. When you strength train to fatigue, you are breaking down your muscle fibers to rebuild later. \nBy cooling down and stretching post-workout, you will decrease the potential or at least the degree of sore muscles a few days later. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight Train After 50 for Longevity\n\n\n\nThe good news is that we can beat the odds by continuing to weight train, helping to build and maintain muscles throughout life! So what are you waiting for, grab a pair of weights and get started with your weight training journey today! \n\n\n\nREAD THIS NEXT: How To Prevent Menopausal Weight Gain\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness for Women Over 50"
