"Whether you’re just getting started strength training or you’ve been in the groove for a while, it’s important to be educated on how you can get the most out of your workouts. For busy lifestyles, it makes sense to train multiple muscle groups in one session instead of one muscle group at a time.\nOne of the most common questions people have when they first start strength training is what muscle groups to work out together and how often to train each one.\nFirst, let’s look at the basic minimum guidelines for resistance training given by The American College of Sports Medicine (“ACSM”):\n\nDo some kind of strength training a minimum of twice a week.\nHealthy adults perform at least one set of 8-12 repetitions\n8-10 exercises should be performed to target the major muscle groups: Chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, abdomen, quadriceps and hamstrings\n\nTraining Opposing Muscle Groups\nOne of the most common ways to lift weights and certainly a favorite of weight lifters everywhere is to train opposing muscle groups. These opposing muscles are also called agonist and antagonists and they work together for many of the movements we make. Simply put, you are working both the front and the back part of one particular area of the body on the same day.\nHow do you separate muscle groups when working out? The goal is to train the opposing muscle groups in the same session.\nAnd because you need 48 hours of rest for the muscle you work, it is convenient to follow up the next day with a different part of the body. This gives your muscle groups time to recover.\nMajor Muscle Groups to Workout Together\nHere are a few popular options for which muscle groups to work out together:\n\nChest and Back\nQuads and Hamstrings\nBiceps, Triceps and Shoulders\nGlutes and Abdominals\n\nClick on the bulleted list above to quickly jump to each individual strength training workout.\nLike we mentioned, these are a few popular options for certain muscle groups to workout together, but this is by no means an exclusive list. Nevertheless, we have created the below four workouts that engage complimentary muscle groups together.\n\nMuscle Groups to Workout Together\n1. Chest & Back Workout\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you’re getting ready for tank top season or just want to feel good about your upper body, this workout is going to be it for you! But just remember, you have to lift weights in order to strengthen and tone your arms, just like you do your lower body!\nThese upper body movements will round out your chest and back muscles, focusing on the front and back side of your upper body!\nEquipment: Medium-to-heavy set of dumbbells. I tend to use 12 lb dumbbells when I work my upper body. Feel free to use anywhere between 8 lb and 15 lb dumbbells. Choose the weight that allows you to complete the workout and is still a little challenging!\nInstructions: This upper body workout will be done in a circuit type format. Complete each exercise for a total of 45 seconds and rest for 15 seconds. The 15-second rest is to catch your breath and get you ready for the next movement.\n1. Chest Fly\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how to perform chest flys:\n\nLie on back with knees bent and feet on floor and hold dumbbells straight up over chest.\nWith a slight bend in the elbow, slowly open arms wide out to the side. Squeeze your chest as you bring    the weights back together at the top. Repeat for desired number of reps.\n\n2. Renegade Row\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how to do a renegade row:\n\nBegin in a full plank with dumbbells in hands, arms extended, and on toes. (kneeling variation is fine if you are not able to do a full plank) Engage your abdominals drawing the belly inward towards your spine.\nPull right dumbbell up toward right hip bone keeping weight close to your side. Slowly return it to the floor and repeat with the left dumbbell.\n\nThis will have your chest, shoulders, and triceps burning – and your heart rate up\n3. Push-Up\n\n\n\n\n\nThe push-up targets several muscle groups all in one efficient exercise. Here’s how to do a push-up:\n\nBegin in a plank position with hands below shoulders, legs long behind you, and body contracted to hold your spine in a straight line.\nWith elbows pointing slightly back, bend elbows and slowly begin to lower your body until you are just above the ground. Keep your gaze over your fingertips and body in a straight line.\nAs you exhale, tighten your belly and push yourself back up to a plank position. That is one repetition.\n\n4. Reverse Grip Double Arm Rows \n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how to do reverse grip double arm rows:\n1) Start with legs together and sit back into a slight squat engaging abdominals. Arms are in front of the body holding dumbbells at hip height with palms facing the ceiling.\n2) Draw elbows back past hips gently hugging the side body so you feel lats and triceps engage and return forward with control.\nThis exercise targets the back muscles which is an often-overlooked muscle group in women.\n5. Chest Press\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how to perform a chest press:\n\nLie on back with knees bent and feet on the floor. Elbows are bent and dumbbells start at shoulder height.\nExtend arms fully pressing away from your chest. Slowly lower to start position.\n\nYour chest, shoulders, and triceps get major muscle-building benefits from this move.\n6. Overhead Pull\n\n\n\n\n\nThis targets the shoulders and triceps muscle group. Here’s how to perform an overhead pull:\n\nLie on back with knees bent and feet on the floor. Arms are extended above chest to start. Engage your abdominals.\nLower dumbbells past your head keeping arms mostly straight with elbows slightly bent. Keeping abdominals tight raise dumbbells back to start. Low back should stay firm against the floor throughout.\n\nRepeat the circuit 3 times through for a complete 20-minute upper body workout!\nRelated: What’s The Difference Between Muscle Strength and Muscle Endurance?\n\n2. Quads & Hamstring Workout\n\n\n\n\n\nDid someone say leg day?! Lower body strength training workouts are some of the most commonly searched workouts on the internet because who doesn’t love a good leg burn?\nThe goal of this workout is to target the quad and hamstring muscles together and to find fatigue in your lower body. If you get to the last couple of reps and you feel like you can’t do one more, that’s exactly where you should be. If you come to the last couple of reps and feel like you could do more, pick up heavier weights!
