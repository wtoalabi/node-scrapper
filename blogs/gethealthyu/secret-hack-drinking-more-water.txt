If you heard these three adjectives in an advertisement, you’d be tempted to Amazon Prime the product ASAP, right?\nGood news. You can get this product right now, no wait time. Just take a trip to your faucet and turn the knob counter-clockwise.\nI’m talking about water, friends! If you’ve followed me for a long time, then you know that I don’t believe in “miracle” products, but with water making up 60 percent of our body weight, I’ve changed my tune.\nWater IS a miracle product. Don’t believe me? Then take a look at everything this liquid does for your body and health.\nWater helps to:\n\nFlush toxins out of vital organs\nCarry nutrients to cells\nRegulate body temperature\nLubricate and cushion joints\nAid the digestive system\nHelp the brain manufacture hormones and neurotransmitters\nProtect your spinal cord and other sensitive tissues\nAnd if you have seen the viral news story floating around about a woman who drank three liters of water a day for four weeks, water can even affect your appearance!\n\nNow that you know the facts, let’s talk about your fill.\nThe Institute of Medicine says the adequate intake for men is roughly 13 cups (3 liters) of total beverages a day and 9 cups (2.2 liters) a day for women.\nTotal beverages? This can include coffee or tea but the majority of your intake (I’m talking 8 cups) should be from water. And if you engage in moderate exercise (not talking about running a marathon!) you should add an extra 1.5 to 2.5 cups of water to your day.\nIf you have trouble gulping the good stuff, here is my all-time favorite hydration hack! All you need is a water bottle and a permanent marker.\nThe Secret Hack To Drinking More Water\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Get A Water Bottle\nDo your best to find a 32-ounce see-through plastic water bottle or the biggest size you can find. Mine looks like a glass mason jar, but it’s plastic. Also, I’ve found that I always drink more water if it’s out of a straw.\nWhy 32 ounces? That means if you guzzle it twice, that’s 64 ounces or 8 cups!\nStep 2: Grab a Marker!\nTake your permanent marker and write AM on the left side of the top portion of the water bottle and PM on the right side.\nThen, write “Refill” at the very bottom.\nStep 3: Write Your Timing\nDecide how you want to divide your water bottle. I did 7 AM, 9 AM, 11 AM, and noon on the left side. Once I drink all of the water, which should be around noon, I refill it all the way to the top.\nFor my PM water drinking goals, I chose 1 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM, and 6 PM. I work out in the morning, so I don’t tend to drink water late at night.\nIf you work out at night, you might want to make your last time around 8 or 9 PM.\nStep 4: Sip Up!\nGet drinking! Your goal is to reach the line by the listed time. So for 11 AM, you want the water level to be down to that line at that time.\nKeep going and you’ll be well on your way to reaching your water goals!\nNot into DIY? So many people love this way of drinking water that now these water bottles exist to buy! Check out this great option below:\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed more hydration hacks?\n1. Drink lemon water first thing in the morning.\nEvery single morning before I eat or drink anything—and that includes my coffee—I reach for a big glass of lemon water. I squeeze about half a lemon into 12 to 16 ounces of room temperature water and sip. If you get into this habit, that’s 1.5 to 2 cups already crossed off the list before your morning shower! But why lemon water? Read about the five important health benefits here.\n2.
