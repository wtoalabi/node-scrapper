"Hip pain is a common and frustrating complaint that can be caused by many things—everything from athletic injuries and pinched nerves to arthritis or osteoporosis. The truth is, everything in your body is connected and in order to alleviate hip pain, you’ll want to not only work the hip flexors themselves but the surrounding muscles that support them. (Did you know that even your feet and ankles have a role to play in supporting your hips and keeping them pain-free?) Let’s learn more about what can cause hip tightness and then learn seven exercises to relieve tight hips.\nWhat Causes Tight Hips?\nHip tightness or pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\nSitting for prolonged periods of time\nInjury to the hips\nOveruse by excessive running or exercise\nConstantly crossing your legs while you sit\nTendonitis or bursitis of the hip\nProblems with your psoas muscle\n\nThat last point is important. The psoas muscle (pronounced “so-as”) is actually a very common cause of hip pain, and you may not have even heard of it. Let’s learn more about what the psoas does and how it can contribute to hip tightness or pain.\nHow The Psoas Muscle Contributes To Hip Tightness\nYour psoas is essentially the deepest muscle in your core, responsible not just for hip rotation and extension but virtually every movement you make, whether it’s walking, jogging, or just standing tall. The psoas is thick, acting as the only muscle that connects the upper body to the lower body (the lumbar vertebrae to the femur).\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf your psoas is weak it can cause postural problems and hip pain or tightness.  A weak psoas muscle causes the hips and quadriceps to work overtime, resulting in a chronic feeling of hip tightness and even back pain. It’s an often-overlooked cause of tight hips! Now that you know what may be causing your hip tightness, let’s do something about it, shall we?\n7 Exercises To Relieve Tight Hips\nThese exercises focus on strengthening and stretching your hips, glutes, and yes—that sneaky psoas muscle—so you can be pain-free once again.
