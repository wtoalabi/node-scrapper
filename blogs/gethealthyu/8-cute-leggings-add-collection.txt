"Tights and leggings and spandex, oh, my! I have a serious love affair with leggings. Some girls have a high-heel obsession, but I’m all about the lower body spandex, baby! When I’m teaching a fitness class, I prefer leggings or tights to shorts (better butt coverage!). When I’m out and about, I wear a pair with a long sleeve shirt, a puffy vest and a cute pair of boots. Even though I’m technically wearing workout clothes, I don’t scream “gym rat.” Leggings have come a long way from just being sporty and comfortable; they are super cute, majorly in style and I’ve come to pride myself on knowing which are the best workout leggings around. And if you don’t think you can pull off a legging, you’re wrong! Every body type can rock a good tight in AND outside of the gym!  Go bold, have fun, be crazy. If you don’t think you can wear stripes or pattern–YES YOU CAN! As a matter of fact, a bold pattern actually camouflages and minimizes! And stay away from VPL (Visible Panty Line). Lumpy undergarments plus leggings is a bad mix! Ready to get your legging love on? Here are 8 of the best workout leggings to grow (or start!) your collection!\n1.
