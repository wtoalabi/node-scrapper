"Loose, bagged, hot, or iced. However you take your tea, you’re in luck! Tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world, second only to water, and for good reason.\nBesides being one of the most delicious caffeine options (yeah, we said it out loud, Coffee), tea is basically a super-drink!\nBlack, green, oolong, and white teas all come from a single plant called Camellia Sinensis. Many studies suggest that the antioxidants and various vitamins and minerals contained in tea brewed from this plant really do a body good.\nHere are eight awesome health benefits of tea.\n1) Reduce Belly Fat\n\n\n\n\n\nA study from the Journal of Nutrition found that participants who consumed green tea AND maintained an exercise program (Green tea is not a “Get Out Of Exercise Free”card!) had a greater reduction in total abdominal fat area compared to a control group.\n2) Protect Eyesight\nHere’s another reason to go green. A study from China found that the antioxidants in green tea can be absorbed deep inside your eyes, which may help protect them against disease.\n3) Strengthen Your Heart\nA stronger heart could be correlated with a strong cup of tea. Studies have found that drinking three to four cups of tea a day can cut the chances of having a heart attack.\nRelated: 7 Steps For Heart Health\n4) Prevent Tooth Decay\n\n\n\n\n\nFloss, brush, and drink tea?

A study found that green tea can improve bone mineral density and strength. (Green tea mustaches are the next big thing, trust us.)\n7) Reduce Stress\n\n\n\n\n\nA cuppa tea may just be the new yoga. A study by University College London found that people who drank black tea were able to de-stress more quickly than those who drank a fake tea substitute.\n8) Lower Blood Pressure\nHigh blood pressure can lead to a slew of medical problems including heart disease. A study from the Journal of the American Medical Association found that drinking 3 cups of black tea for 6 months lowered systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.\nThe bottom line: Drinking tea does more than give your pinky a workout.
