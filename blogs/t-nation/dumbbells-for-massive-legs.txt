"Exercise, including resistance training, acts as a stress on the body. We’re accustomed to thinking of stress as a negative, but when it comes to training, stress applied in the correct doses is a good thing – because stress is the trigger that causes physiological adaptation to occur.\nFor example, apply the correct amount of aerobic stress to the body and it will adapt by becoming more aerobically fit. Similarly, apply the correct level of stress using resistance training, and the body reacts by increasing muscle size and strength. Thus, when it comes to training, stress applied in the correct doses produces positive results.\nHowever, one of the challenges for lifters is that the body adapts quickly. The trick, then, is to manipulate the stress of exercise often enough to keep the adaptation rate at an optimal level while avoiding becoming over trained.\nWhile there are a number of variables (e.g., rest times, sets and reps, training speed, training intensity) you can manipulate to keep the stress of resistance training elevated, one of the most significant variables to manipulate is exercise selection.\nBy providing exercise variation each workout, and then adjusting the specific exercises performed every 4-6 weeks, the body will continually be faced with an elevated level of training stress.\nFor the lower body there are the typical barbell lower body exercises (squats, deadlifts, and straight leg deadlifts) that can be performed along with various exercise machines (leg press, hack squat, leg extensions, etc.).\nHowever, one variation that isn’t often considered is performing lower body training with dumbbells. I’ve been using dumbbell lower body exercises to supplement the barbell lower body exercises we perform with my collegiate athletes with great success for a number of years now.\nSome of you might be thinking that it will be impossible to overload the musculature of the lower body using dumbbells, but I guarantee that if you perform these exercises with strict technique and high intensity, you’ll be fully aware of your training the next day.\nTraining with dumbbells also provides some specific advantages:\n\nVariety. Dumbbells obviously add variety to the training program, and we just discussed the benefit that provides.\nSafety. Dumbbells provide a safer way to train when performing certain exercises. For example, one-legged squats are a great muscle-building exercise that also challenges your balance. When done with a barbell on your back, though, it can create a potential injury opportunity. However, when performing one-legged squats with dumbbells, the lifter can simply drop the dumbbells and eliminate the injury concern.\nNovelty. Dumbbells provide a unique training stimulus simply because the load placement differs compared to performing the same exercises with a barbell. When performing barbell squats or lunges, the bar is placed on the back. In contrast, when performing these exercises with dumbbells, the load is held in the hands.\n\nEven when performing an exercise that requires the barbell to be held in the hands, such as a straight leg deadlift (SLDL), the load placement still differs because the barbell is held in front of the legs, in contrast to performing SLDL’s with dumbbells where the dumbbells are held to the sides of the legs.\nWhen the load placement differs the muscle recruitment pattern, by necessity, also changes. This variation in muscle recruitment helps keep both the stress of exercise and thus the rate of adaption elevated.\nThe following are some of my favorite dumbbell variations of the classic lower body barbell exercises. In terms of programming, use the same training protocol on dumbbell days as barbell days.\nFor example, if in a hypertrophy training cycle, do these dumbbell lower body exercises for 4 sets of 8-12 repetitions with 60 seconds of rest between sets. If in a strength cycle, perform 5 sets of 3-6 repetitions with 2 minutes rest between sets.\nTo assist you, exercise technique instructions are provided as well as common mistakes to avoid. Video demonstrations are also included, so that you can see the exercises performed correctly.\nDumbbell Squat\n \n\n\nInstructions\n\nGrasp a dumbbell in each hand with the arms fully extended.\nHold the dumbbells along the sides of the body.\nAssume a shoulder-width stance.\nArch the back, keep the head up.\nMaintaining an arched-back position, initiate the movement by sitting back at the hips.\nContinue to sit back until a parallel thigh position has been achieved. The center of the hip joint should be at the same height as the center of the knee joint.\nThe heels should be down. The knees can drift slightly forward of the toes, be kept in line directly above the toes, or be lined up slightly behind the toes, depending upon what’s most comfortable to the athlete.\nLeading with the head (as opposed to lifting the hips first) return to the starting position. The back should remain arched and the head should be up.\n\nCommon Errors\n\nAllowing the back to round rather than maintaining an arched-back position during performance of the exercise.\nNot achieving a parallel thigh position at the bottom of the movement.\nInitiating the movement with the knee joint moving forward rather than initiating the movement with the hip sitting back. Often this can result in the heel lifting off the ground because of incorrect position.\nLowering the weight too quickly rather than controlling the movement during the descent.\n\nDumbbell Single-Leg Squat\n \n\n\nInstructions\n\nGrasp a dumbbell in each hand with the arms fully extended.\nHold the dumbbells along the sides of the body.\nAssume a shoulder-width stance.\nArch the back, keep the head up.\nReach back with the left leg and place the left foot on a bench or plyometric box that’s approximately knee height.\nThe right foot should be placed far enough forward of the bench that you are now in a lunge position.\nMaintaining an arched-back position, initiate the movement by sitting back at the hips.\nContinue to sit back until a parallel thigh position has been achieved. The center of the hip joint should be at the same height as the center of the knee joint.\nThe heels should be down. The knees can drift slightly forward of the toes, be kept in line directly above the toes, or be lined up slightly behind the toes, depending upon what is most comfortable to the athlete.\nLeading with the head (as opposed to lifting the hips first) return to the starting position. The back should remain arched and the head should be up.\n\nCommon Errors\n\nAllowing the back to round rather than maintaining an arched-back position during performance of the exercise.\nNot achieving a parallel thigh position at the bottom of the movement. This is especially common when performing a one-leg squat so emphasize correct depth.\nInitiating the movement with the knee joint moving forward rather than initiating the movement with the hip sitting back. Often this results in the heel lifting off the ground because of incorrect position.\nLowering the weight too quickly rather than controlling the movement during the descent.\n\nDumbbell Front Squat\n \n\n\nInstructions\n\nGrasp a dumbbell in each hand with the arms fully extended.\nPlace the dumbbells front to back on the shoulders, with the back end of the dumbbells resting on the shoulders.

The center of the hip joint should be at the same height as the center of the knee joint.\nThe heels should be down. The knees can drift slightly forward of the toes, be kept in line directly above the toes, or be lined up slightly behind the toes, depending upon what is most comfortable to the athlete.\nLeading with the head (as opposed to lifting the hips first), return to the starting position. The back should remain arched and the head should be up.\n\nCommon Errors\n\nAllowing the back to round rather than maintaining an arched-back position during performance of the exercise. Focusing on keeping the elbows high will help eliminate this problem.\nNot achieving a parallel thigh position at the bottom of the movement.\nInitiating the movement with the knee joint moving forward rather than initiating the movement with the hip sitting back.
