"Long duration, low intensity cardio. High intensity interval training\n(HIIT). Thirty to sixty minutes of moderate intensity work.\nWith all the options and opinions out there, is it any wonder that people\nare confused as to how they should incorporate cardio into their workouts?\nLet me begin by saying that I hate the word cardio. Cardio sounds\nlike something you do for your heart, not something you do to get lean.\nAfter all, the most important thing in life is getting uber jacked, right? \nOkay I’m kidding. But only a little!\nWhile “energy system training” (EST) may not sound as mainstream as “cardio” does,\nit has a cooler ring to it. If you tell people you have an intense EST\nworkout, you just sound like you know what you’re doing!\nLet’s look at the pros and cons of each type of EST available to us,\nalong with ways to incorporate each to develop a superior fat burning\nprotocol. \nBut first, a quick primer to get you up to speed.\n\nThe Cardio Continuum\nIf you recall from several of my articles, I’ve put the following continuum\ninto the mix:\n <img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001-7.jpg\" alt=\"Cardio Conundrum\" width=\"451\" height=\"36\" />\n\n\nNeural\nMetabolic\n\n\nOn the left hand side of the continuum we have training methods that\nare intensive with regards to the nervous system. These types of training\nmethods are generally harder overall on the body and require greater\nrecovery time.\nOn the right side of the equation, we have training methods that are\nmore intensive with regards to the metabolic system. These types of methods\nare generally less stressful to the body and require less time to recovery\nfrom.\nWhen examining energy system training, many of the same general rules\napply. In this case, the continuum may look something like this:\n <img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001-7.jpg\" alt=\"Cardio Conundrum\" width=\"451\" height=\"36\" />\n\n\nInterval Training\nLong Duration, Low Intensity\n\n\nUsed in more practical setting, the left side of the continuum could\nbe someone who’s performing sprints. On the right side of the continuum\nare the people who are plodding away for hours on end on the recumbent\nbike. \nAs a general rule the methods on the left side increase training intensity,\nand therefore take longer to recover from between workouts. In contrast,\nthe methods on the right side are lower intensity in nature, and can\nbe performed more often.\nOnce you understand this continuum, you’ll see that all training mediums\nfall somewhere along it. The goal is to determine not only which is more\nbeneficial for you, but how to employ the cardio into overall training\nprogram to get maximal results.\nRather than droning on and on with endless theory, let’s focus on the\npractical side of the equation — how you can best utilize energy\nsystem training to help you shed body fat and get lean. \nWith that being said, I’m not even going to touch on low intensity,\nlong duration cardio. While there are certain populations and instances\nwhere it may be appropriate, the bottom line is that for most, it’s a\ncop-out.\nYes, it’s true that low intensity workouts will burn the greatest percentage\nof fat; but that’s only because the intensity is so low! Following this\nline of thinking, lying on your couch is downright thermogenic! Instead\nof focusing solely on burning fat, I’d rather have someone work hard,\nburn a ton of calories, and let the chips fall where they may.\nLet’s examine what I consider to be the three biggest exercise tools\nwe have at our disposal: Strength training, interval training, and steady\nstate work.\n\nStrength Training\n <!–\nAs I’m writing this, I’m going to assume you’re following a strength\ntraining program similar to the one I outlined here.\nIf you’re not, or if you haven’t read the article first, definitely do\nthat before moving on. \n–>\nAn intelligently designed weight training regimen should be the cornerstone\nof your fat loss program. A smart training program will not only crank\nup your metabolism within the workout, but aid you in building muscle\nto help you burn more fat outside of the workout, as well. \n <img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image004-5.jpg\" alt=\"Cardio Conundrum\" width=\"328\" height=\"455\" />\nMolly knows all about the positive effects of lifting heavy; so should\nyou!\nAction Item: After you’ve designed your strength training program,\ncommit to performing it at least two to three times per week, with at\nleast one day of rest in between.\nHigh Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)\nHIIT, also known as interval training, is currently the hot topic when\nit comes to fat loss workouts — and for good reason. Intervals\nare in many ways superior to traditional steady-state training with regards\nto fat loss. \nDue to the intensity of the workouts, chances are you’re going to be\nburning a ton of calories when you perform interval training. Couple\nthat with the fact that your metabolism stays elevated for quite some\ntime after you’re done training, and you have a very potent fat burning\nstimulus.\nUnfortunately, intervals aren’t for everyone, especially in the beginning.\nI would never have someone who’s one hundred pounds overweight performing\nsprints or other high-impact activities. \nHowever, there are tons of great options you can incorporate that will\ntotally kick your butt! Here are a few ideas:\nKettlebell/Dumbbell Swings on the Minute \nI got this from strength coach and good friend Geoff Neupert. Take a\nkettlebell, and when the second hand on a clock gets to\n“12”, perform 10 swings. When you’re done, you get the rest of the minute\nto rest. When the clock gets back to the “12”, you’ve got 10 more swings. \nStart off for 5 minutes and work your way up to 10. From there, you\ncan increase the number of swings on the minute, which will alter the\nwork to rest ratio.\n <img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image006-4.jpg\" alt=\"Cardio Conundrum\" width=\"348\" height=\"522\" />\nCaroline Radway, UK-Based Personal Trainer\nAirdyne Bike\nPeople scoff at the Airdyne when they come into our gym, but they don’t\nlaugh at it when they’re done! \nAgain, a work to rest ratio of 1 to 3 is the standard starting point,\nwith people either going 20 on, 60 off or 30 on, 90 off. After a full-bore\nworkout, no one wants to see the Airdyne!\nHopefully you ladies get the point here. It doesn’t matter what you\ndo — kettlebell swings, bike or treadmill sprints, tire flips,\nor hitting the heavy bag. The key is it must be intense, and it\nmust be brief.\nAction Item: Following your strength training workouts, plan\non incorporating several rounds of intervals into your programming. On\nthe low end I’d start with 3 rounds, and on the high-end you can work\nup to 6 or 8. Another good rule of thumb is to begin with a 1:3 work:rest\nratio, and over time decrease that to 1:2.\n\nModerate Intensity, Steady-State Work\nModerate intensity steady-state work has been thrown under the bus lately,\nand I’m not exactly sure why. Sure, it’s not as effective as intervals\nat burning body fat, but it still has its role.\nFirst off, you simply can’t perform intervals every day. You will either\nburn out, get injured, or both. Moderate steady-state work, however,\ncan be performed almost daily with minimal repercussions (outside of\nan overuse injury if you do the same thing time and again). \nAs well, it doesn’t take nearly as much “mental currency” to perform\na steady state workout. Quite simply, it’s not as hard as hitting the\niron or enduring an intense interval workout!\nIn the case of steady state work, we need to work at a relatively good\nintensity without killing ourselves. If you’re gasping for breath, can’t\ntalk, and feel like you’re about to have a heart attack, you’re working\ntoo hard! A good way to think about this is the difference between breathing\nheavy and breathing hard.\nThe biggest issue most people have with steady-state work is that it\ngets boring. If this is the case with you, mix it up! You can jog, ride\na bike, swim, and use a stairclimber or a rowing machine. \nThe limiting factor here is really just your imagination. If nothing\nelse, throw your iPod on and listen to a good, informative podcast while\ntraining. You’ll get smarter and the time will go by faster to boot!\nAction Item: Try and get a minimum of at least one steady state\nworkout in per week on non-strength/interval days. Two is even better,\nif you can swing it. \nWhile three may be “ideal” with regards to shedding body fat and burning\ncalories, it can also be mentally draining getting into the gym six times\nper week. If your only goal is to get uber lean with quickness, though,\nthis will serve you well. \nStart with a minimum of twenty to thirty minutes and work up to sixty\nas your conditioning improves.\n\nBringing It All Together\nOver the past two articles we’ve discussed both the strength training\nand cardio sides of the equation. Below is a sample program for someone\nwho needs help getting started. \nI like this program set-up because it allows someone plenty of time\nto train during the week, while giving them a mental break from the gym\non the weekend. It’s intense, but not so intense that they risk burning\nout or totally hating the gym!\n\n\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nSaturday\nSunday\n\n\nWorkout AIntervals\nSteady State – Bike\nWorkout BIntervals\nSteady State – Jog\nWorkout AIntervals\nOff\nOff\n\n\nWorkout A\nDynamic Warm-up\n1A) Squats, 3×10, 90 seconds rest\n1B) Bench Press, 3×10, 90 seconds rest\n2A) RDL’s, 3×10, 90 seconds rest\n2B) Pull-ups, 3×10, 90 seconds rest\n3A) Shoulder I, T, Y, 2×8 each, 30 seconds\nrest\n3B) DB Curls, 2×10, 30 seconds rest\n3C) Dead Bugs, 2×12, 30 seconds rest\nKB Swings on the Minute, 10 swings\nfor 5 minutes\nWorkout B\n1A) Deadlifts, 3×10, 90 seconds rest\n1B) DB Rows, 3×10, 90 seconds rest\n2A) DB Lunges, 3×10, 90 seconds rest\n2B) DB Overhead Press, 3×10, 90 seconds\nrest\n3A) DB External Rotation, 2×12, 30 seconds rest\n3B) Prone Scaptions,  2×12,\n30 seconds rest\n3B) Ab Wheel Rollouts, 2×8-10, 30 seconds rest\nAirdyne Sprints, 20 on, 60\noff, 3 rounds\n <img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image008-7.jpg\" alt=\"Cardio Conundrum\" width=\"224\" height=\"337\" />\nSummary\nI hope this article has shed some light on which energy system training\nmethods are the most effective for getting super lean.
