"Here’s what you need to know…\n\nPhysiques that exude power are made of massive lats, traps, and delts. And they don’t just look powerful, they are powerful.\nTo achieve the power look, you’ll need to get strong overall and improve your 3RM.\nFocus on four main lifts with added accessory lifts. The purpose of the accessory lifts is to increase your 3RM on the main lifts.\nThere are three phases of this 10-week program. It’s periodized so that your main lifts increase in load while your assistance work decreases in volume.\n\nDefining The Power Look\nFew people have a physique that looks powerful and intimidating. And I want what few people have. Don’t you?\nPicture this: Strong traps that slope down to rounded shoulders, a thick upper back, a lower back you can lose your forearm in, and tree-trunk legs. Now couple that look with strength – being able to move the equivalent of a small car on the big basics.\nThis is the physique most lifters want. I designed this program for them.\nWhen you’re striving to achieve the power look, strength has to be the foundation of your training. Not necessarily 1RM strong, but overall strong.\nTrain toward achieving a new 3RM. The ultimate goal is to get 3 solid sets of 3 reps with your pre-cycle 1RM. That alone will guarantee a 10-15% gain in strength.\nThis program is built for a “big athlete” look. Think fullback or linebacker bodies. It will build muscle in all the right places and build the strength to back up the look.\nMaking the Program Work\nThe purpose of this program is to turn you into one powerful-looking human being. This is not the time to start a fat-loss diet!\nWe don’t want to get fat in our quest for looking like a tank, but it would be a huge mistake not to consume enough nutrients to fuel the workouts, recover, and then grow from them.\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Plazma.jpg\" alt=\"Plazma\" />\n\nYou want at least a 10% caloric surplus when doing this program. For supplements, I had my greatest improvements when I was consuming a high amount of Plazma™ pre and during training as well as Mag-10® post-training.\nThe Workouts\nI’ll provide a week-by-week breakdown of the program below, but let’s start with an overview of each section.\nFocus on four main lifts. These exercises are selected for their capacity to give you the power look. By themselves they’ll give you the body you want. Getting significantly stronger at these movements will earn you the power look.\nBut you’ll also use assistance exercises, which will increase the rate of progress in the main movements. Everything you do is designed to push the big four as high as possible, because getting the big-four higher is what will get you looking like a beast.\nThe Power 4\n\nFront squat\nDeadlift\nBench press\nPush press\n\n\nEach workout contains three total exercises: One main movement (from the Power 4) and two assistance exercises to improve the main lift.\nThe program has three distinct phases: The main movements stay the same for the duration of the cycle (10 weeks) but the assistance exercises will change depending on the purpose they serve.\nThe main movements are periodized: The load is planned in advance for the whole cycle and based on testing your 1RM just prior to starting the training cycle.\n\nThe periodization scheme for the main movements:\n\nWeek 1: 80%, 5 x 3\nWeek 2: 80%, 5 x 4\nWeek 3: 80%, 5 x 5\nWeek 4: 80%, 5 x 6\nWeek 5: 85%, 3 x 3\nWeek 6: 85%, 5 x 3\nWeek 7: 90%, 3 x 3\nWeek 8: 95%, 3 x 2\nWeek 9: 100%, 3 x 2\nWeek 10: 100%, 3 x 3\n\nAfter week 10, take three easy days and then test your new 1RM.\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bent-Over-Barbell-Row.jpg\" alt=\"Bent Over Barbell Row\" />\n\nThe Assistance Work\nThe program below has two assistance movements for each main lift during each training phase.\nAt the beginning of the program, the purpose of the assistance exercises will be to strengthen weak links in the main lifts. As the program progresses you’ll shift your focus more on getting ready to handle bigger weights.\nThis means emphasizing the stronger links in the main lifts so that you’re able to reach peak performance at the end of the cycle.\nNote: For the assistance work you won’t use pre-planned loads like you will for the main lifts. Shoot for the heaviest load you can handle with proper form for all the work sets. Don’t hit failure on purpose, but if it happens once in a while don’t worry about it.\nPhase 1 – Assistance Exercises\nPhase 1 Notes: The two assistance exercises are selected to fix generally weak areas in the main lifts and build the key muscles involved.\n\nFront squat assistance exercises\nPaused front squat\nSplit squat\n\nDeadlift assistance exercises\nDeficit deadlift\nBent over barbell row (torso parallel to the floor)\n\nBench press assistance exercises\nFull range dumbbell press(flat, lowering the dumbbells so that the handles are lower than a bench press bar would be)\nFloor press, close-grip\n\nPush press assistance exercises\nMilitary press\nHigh incline (60 degrees) dumbbell press\n\nSets and reps for the phase 1 assistance exercises\nWeek 1: 4 x 8\nWeek 2: 2 x 8, 2 x 6 (heavier)\nWeek 3: 4 x 6\nWeek 4: 2 x 6\n\nPhase 2 – Assistance Exercises\nPhase 2 Notes: One exercise will continue working on a weak link for the main lift, but the second exercise will be an overload movement for the pattern to get used to handling heavier weights.\n\nFront squat assistance exercises\n1 and 1/4th front squat (Go all the way down, then up halfway, back down, stand up. This is one rep.)\n1/2 front squat (Going down only until the knee is at 100 degrees.)\n\nDeadlift assistance exercises\nDeficit sumo deadlift\nDeadlift from pins just below knees\n\nBench press assistance exercises\nWide-grip bench press\n1/2 bench press (Normal bench press, lowering until elbows are 90 degrees.)\n\nPush press assistance exercises\nTop-half press from pins (Shoulder press from pins just above forehead.)\n1/2 push press (From rack position to just above forehead.)\n\nSets and reps for the phase 2 assistance exercises\nWeek 5: 4 x 6\nWeek 6: 2 x 6, 2 x 4 (heavier)\nWeek 7: 4 x 4\n\nPhase 3 – Assistance Exercises\nPhase-3 Notes: The goal of the assistance movements is no longer about correcting weak links. Use them instead to emphasize strong links.\nUse only assistance movements where you can use more weight than on the main lifts themselves. The volume of assistance work will be dropped to allow maximum recovery to peak for the main lifts.\n\nFront squat assistance exercise\nBack squat, narrow stance (hip width), high bar position\n\nDeadlift assistance exercise\nDeadlift from pins just above knees\n\nBench press assistance exercise\nDecline bench press\n\nPush press assistance exercise\nPower jerk\n\nSets and reps for the phase 3 assistance exercises\nWeek 8: 4 x 2\nWeek 9: 2 x 2\nWeek 10: None\n\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Back-1.jpg\" alt=\"Back\" />\n\nThe Complete Power Look Program\nWeek 1 – Day 1\n\nFront squat: 80%, 5 x 3\nPaused front squat: (2 second pause in the bottom position) 4 x 8\nSplit squat: (bar held like in a front squat) 4 x 8\nOptional bonus work: Leg press, leg extension, hack squat.
