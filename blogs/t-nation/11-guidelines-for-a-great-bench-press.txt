"Here’s what you need to know…\n\nYou should train your bench press and groove proper bench technique several times a week.\nPush the bar forcefully all the way from the bottom to lockout. You should do this on every single rep you do.\nTo be a great bencher, forget other pressing exercises for a while and focus only on the bench.\nOnly beginners can bench press heavy every time they train and still make progress. Advanced lifters need to train smarter.\n\nThe Lost Art of the Bench Press\nIt never ceases to amaze me the number of exercises some people do for chest – inclines, declines, flyes, cables, dumbbells, dips, pec deck, and machine presses done once a week. Lots of reps and sets and most done to failure.\nNo wonder you can’t bench more than once a week this way. Your perpetual soreness is as much a reality as your lack of bench press progress. There are many roads to bench press heaven, but the preceding is not one of them.\nThis is what you need to do:\n\nImprove your bench press style and technique\nTrain the bench press more often\nTrain fewer lifts\n\nBench Often, Bench Optimally\nYou should train your bench press and groove proper bench technique as often as possible.\nOf course, claiming that high frequency benching is the only way to a massive bench is an outright lie, but it’s a fact that the more often you train a movement, the better you get at it.\nNeural pathways stimulated frequently lead to improved technical skills and a more efficient nervous system. You increase your chances of success by training more frequently.\nAttention to detail is another important aspect of becoming a better bencher. There’s no use training the bench press five times per week unless the lowering and pressing of the bar is done with laser-like precision.\n11 Bench Press Guidelines\nDue to anatomical differences in leverage, the way one good lifter bench presses might not fit another, but there are still certain guidelines that work for almost all lifters:\n\nInhale as much air as possible.\nMake your ribcage as large as possible after having sucked in all that air.\n“Push/pull” the tip of the sternum as high up in the air as you can. This is the point where the bar will hit on your chest/upper abs. Big, shirted lifters will usually lower the bar farther down onto their big guts. Raw benchers and leaner lifters will find their sweet spot a little higher up, usually close to the nipple area.\nPull your shoulders and scapulae as far back as you’re able to and then down towards your glutes. Keep them there. This will activate your traps, rhomboids and lats, which makes it easier to find and keep the proper bar path.\nAs you grab the bar with your hands at the desired grip width, place your feet as far back as possible, keeping the soles of your feet firmly planted on the floor. Flex your erectors, glutes, legs, and calves. You should now feel tight.\nGet some help from an experienced liftoff-guy who knows the importance of giving you a good liftoff, which doesn’t consist of unracking the bar forcefully so your shoulders are pulled out of position. Dropping the bar fast over your face or giving it horizontal speed doesn’t cut it, either. Nice and easy is how you want it handed to you.\nAt this point, with the bar at arms length, some lifters need to let go of a little air and then fill up again. For God’s sake, don’t lose the arch, the massive abdominal pressure, and the tension you’ve built up. When doing a proper set-up by bridging your body and pulling your scapula back and down, you store energy by creating tension in your muscles and even the fascia surrounding them. This creates more force when pressing the bar and better shoulder stability, which makes for much safer lifting.\nTuck your elbows. Some lifters tuck a little, some tuck a lot. This is something you have to experiment with. The bar is supposed to travel in a slight arc down to the spot on, or close to, the tip of the sternum.\nPause the bar on the chest. It’ll save your shoulders from a lot of wear, tear, and trouble down the road.\nNow it’s time to push the bar up again, and you need to push it like you mean it. Some prefer to ram their feet/heels into the floor a split second before they start pressing, while others prefer to just focus on keeping the tension throughout the body. The bar should travel in a slight arc towards your face. The elbows need to be flared somewhat at exactly the right time in order for the bar to travel in the desired path, so you don’t get stuck in mid-air. Where this elbow flare takes place depends on your leverage. Learn to get a feel for where and when this has to happen. Practice, practice, practice.\nPress the bar to lockout. Time to let go of some air, but not all of it.\n\n \n\n\nWith Utmost Respect and an Eye For Detail\nCheck out bench pressers who have taken their technique and style to a very high level. Swedish lifter Stefan Jamroz comes to mind or pretty much any top level Japanese bench presser.\nThey have really badass lifting style and technique. They treat their bench press like a great artist treats a painting – with utmost respect and an eye for detail.\nSome benchers are naturally fast and explosive due to great leverage and muscles made up of predominantly quick and strong type IIb fibers, while others aren’t as fortunate. However, everybody can still train and practice this skill to the best of their abilities.\nI remember seeing Russian bench presser Vladimir Volkov press a world record weight so fast that it shot off his chest with a speed similar to Putin’s MIG fighters. I talked to Vladimir, 50 years old at the time, about the importance of pressing the weight as fast as possible. “Maksijmum force,” he answered in Russian-English.\nDespite the communication problem, the message was clear: Bench press with maximum force whether you’re lifting sub-maximum or maximum poundages.\nSimilarly, talks of not only exploding the bar off the chest, but also continuously accelerating the bar.\nYou should attempt to push the bar forcefully all the way from the bottom up to lockout. You should do this on every single rep you do, except for the warm-ups.\nThis will teach your nervous system to fire on all “spark plugs,” telling your Golgi tendon organs to back off and not inhibit the speed of the bar.\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Combine.jpg\" alt=\"Combine\" />\n\nA Championship Program\nPlease get rid of the notion that to get stronger you have to bench heavy every time you train the lift. This is simply not true, and only beginners can push to their (limited) limits every time they lift – for a short period of time.\nProgressive weight training is all about putting more weight on the bar. However, you should keep this as a long-term goal, not one that’s attained every single training session.\nVary the intensity and total volume and keep frequency high. Do a heavy training session every three weeks.\nBelow is an excellent program used by Gunda Fiona Sommer-von Bachhaus in preparation for the 2014 European Bench Press Championships where she benched 175kg (385 pounds) at 63kg (139 pounds), making her the best female bench presser in IPF history.\nWarm-ups aren’t listed, but in general do 2-4 sets of progressively heavier fives, but lighter than the percentages listed.\nStart out with two sets of the prescribed daily lifting dosage and then increase to three sets after 2 or 3 three-week cycles.\nWeek 1\n\nDay 1: Test your 1RM raw bench, then do a repetition max with 85% of your 1 RM\nDay 2: 2-3×5 reps at 55% of 1RM\nDay 3: 2-3×5 reps at 65% of 1RM\nDay 4: 2-3×5 reps at 50% of 1RM\nDay 5: 2-3×5 reps at 65% of 1RM\nWeek 2\n\nDay 1: 2-3×5 at 70% of 1RM\nDay 2: 2-3×5 at 55% of 1RM\nDay 3: 2-3×5 at 65% of 1RM\nDay 4: 2-3×5 at 50% of 1RM\nDay 5: 2-3×5 at 65% of 1RM\nWeek 3\n\nDay 1: 2-3×5 at 70% of 1RM\nDay 2: 2-3×5 at 55% of 1RM\nDay 3: 2-3×5 at 65% of 1RM\nDay 4: 2-3×5 at 50% of 1RM\nDay 5: 2-3×5 at 65% of 1RM\nWeek 4\n\nTest your 1 RM and adjust percentages accordingly. Alternatively, do another repetition max with 85% of your 1RM.\nIf you managed 5 reps with this weight 3 weeks ago, then attempt 6 reps today. Every 3 weeks attempt a rep increase with this weight. When you can do 8 reps at this weight, then test your 1 RM next time around in your 3-week cycle.\nYou’ll probably beat your 1RM, and then it’s time to adjust your percentages!\n\nSimplicity (and Frequency) is the Name of the Game\n“I fear not the man who has practiced ten thousand kicks, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick ten thousand times.” – Bruce Lee\nThat describes really well what it takes to become a really good bench presser. You have to bench, bench, and then bench some more. Forget other pressing exercises for a while and focus only on the bench.\nGerman bench presser, Markus Schick, is one of a very select few benchers who’s had world records in five different weight classes. What exercises does he do? Well, he benches."
