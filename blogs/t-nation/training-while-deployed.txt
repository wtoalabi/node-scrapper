"Here’s what you need to know…\n\nA combat-ready body is the best weapon you can have.\nYour best option is a no-nonsense program that you can follow regardless of equipment limitations or scheduling challenges.\nStrength training is hugely important as you never know how big the dude you might have to drag out of harm’s way is going to be, or how far you’ll have to drag him.\nNutrition matters. Electrolytes, EFA’s, sleep aids, and protein are the deployed soldier’s best friend.\n\nBeing on top of your training game while deployed isn’t easy. Unpredictable schedules, inadequate food, lack of sleep, and a high operational tempo all make staying physically sharp a challenge.\nBut it’s also absolutely necessary. Your body is your most important weapons system, and ultimately everything you do in combat will hinge on whether you’ve taken the steps required to prepare your body for combat.\nIt’s also the only weapon you’ll be allowed to keep when you leave the service, so it behooves you to take care of it. Just because you have to wear a flack jacket while you crap into a Zip-Loc bag or eat five-year-old MREs that have been sitting in 120-degree heat while getting shot at doesn’t mean you can’t maintain your physical and mental edge.\nAlthough this article is intended for deployed military personnel, it can also be used by anyone who’s occasionally (or always) strapped for time, doesn’t have access to specialized equipment, or faces a lot of stress that affects his ability to stick to a regular training schedule. If any of the above applies to you, then you might need a “combat conditioning” program.\nMaintaining your physical and mental edge during prolonged stress often comes down to making the best of bad choices. This will help you navigate those decisions.\nWhat is Combat Conditioning?\nCombat conditioning can mean different things to people depending on their background, but as an infantry guy, I’d use the following specifications:\n\nCover 400 meters in less than 2 minutes while wearing 70-90 pounds of gear, then repeat after a 1-minute rest.\nWhile in full gear, carry a buddy (also in full gear) 100 meters, then repeat after a 1-minute rest.\nPerform 10 chin-ups (without kipping) in full gear.\nBox jump above your knee height for 5 reps in full gear.\nPerform 3 reps of a clean and jerk with bodyweight on the bar.\nPerform 3 reps of a single-leg squat with bodyweight on the bar.\n\nThe ability to perform these tasks suggests that you’re able to manipulate your body and an external load in a variety of ways. As a T Nation reader, you likely can do this already – and if you’re in the military, I definitely hope you can.\nMore to the point, if you’re able to do these tasks in a training environment, hopefully when the chips are down and you’re running on adrenaline, you’ll be able to do whatever crazy stuff the moment requires.\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chin-Up.jpg\" alt=\"Chin-Up\" />\n\nThe Plan\nThis training plan is designed to build your work capacity in each energy system by using a variety of compound lifts while increasing endurance through layered anaerobic activity, all while balanced against the challenge of training in an austere environment.\nAlthough military PT is typically associated with running and other endurance work, I prefer to use strength training as it also improves general work capacity and endurance to a degree. However, the reverse isn’t true – and you never know how big the dude you might have to drag out of harm’s way is going to be, or how far you’ll have to drag him. Not to mention, anecdotally, that when you’re tired and hungry your absolute strength levels are going to be much more intact than your endurance is.\nThis program assumes that you have an unpredictable operational tempo and are not fed or rested properly. It has 10 individual workouts that can be recycled ad nauseam. Each workout can be completed in about 45 minutes, and they’re intended to be done back-to-back without rest days. Take rest days when necessary, but the assumption is that you’ll be forced to take days off anyway due to op tempo.\nIn any event, these training sessions shouldn’t leave you feeling sore or drained. If you do find that you’re getting worn down, decrease the overall volume by dropping sets or reps off the assistance work.\nEquipment\nI assume you’ll have access to the following:\n\nOne or more barbells\nA selection of weight plates that may or may not equal your one rep max\nA bench\nA squat rack\nA tire\nDumbbells\nAt least 100-meters of ground that’s relatively free of obstructions and enemy fire\n\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Field_Weight_Room.jpg\" alt=\"Field Weight Room\" />\n\nNutrition\nBetween tray rations and MREs, nutrition is going to be a continuous battle. You’ll have to figure out some sort of supplemental source of chow. If all you’re eating is MREs, you’ll be lucky to get in about 60 grams of protein and a handful of miscellaneous vitamins in an entire day.\nIf you’re wearing your gear all day or otherwise engaged in even moderately strenuous work, this won’t be enough nutrition to keep you from waking up sore the next morning. Furthermore, these engineered food sources are loaded with trans-fats and other stuff you really don’t need to be putting into your body.\nObviously if you’re hungry, you need to eat, but try to get some balance. Nuts and seeds are healthier and more nutrient dense than MREs are. Take a couple of Zip-Loc bags-full and some electrolyte tabs with you out on an op and you won’t need to touch an MRE for at least a couple days.\nI also like throwing protein powder into hot beverage bags as an easy and disposable shaker. Typically, the main meals and the brand-name snacks are your healthiest options when you do have to slice open a box of Case Bs.\n[Editor’s note: There are 24 different MRE menus or varieties. Case A contains menus 1 through 12 and Case B contains menus 13-24.]\nSupplements\nThere are a lot of supplements you can spend your money on, and if you’re in some tiny outpost and haven’t seen a real vegetable in a couple of months, you’ll be tempted to throw your money at everything you see online. Here’s the main stuff you need:\n\nWhey Protein or a protein blend.\nZMA® to help keep your immune system strong and improve sleep quality.\nFiber to clear the last three trays of “Beef Burgundy UGR” out of your system.\nMulti-vitamins, preferably from whole food sources with plenty of B vitamins.\nElectrolytes like Camelbak Elixir tabs and Powerade Drops because they won’t make my Camelbak funky after a couple of weeks in triple-digit heat.\nEditor’s note: CamelBak Products, LLC, makes back-worn water reservoirs for both the military and civilian purposes.\nFish oil, if you have the means, because you’re definitely not getting a lot of EFAs.\nAntioxidants, because your diet probably has zero.\n\nI’d advise against any pre-workout stimulants. Between Rip-Its and Redman, most are putting way too many stimulants into their body as it is. If the only way you can drag yourself to the gym is by pumping yourself full of caffeine, you should really go take a nap.\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bench_Press-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bench Press\" />\n\nThe Program\nDay 1\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA1\nWeighted Chin-Up\n5\n15,10,8,5,1\n \n\n\nA2\nWeighted Dip\n5\n15,10,8,5,1\n2 min.\n\n\nB1\nDumbbell/Barbell Overhead Press\n3\n12\n \n\n\nB2\nDumbbell/Barbell Row\n3\n12\n90 sec.\n\n\nC1\nWeighted Incline Sit-Up or Ab Rollout\n3\n8\n90 sec.\n\n\nC2\nTire Flip\n8\n5\n \n\n\nC3\n100-Meter Shuttle\n8\n1\n45 sec.\n\n\nDay 2\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA1\nSingle-Leg Squat\n5\n3\n \n\n\nA2\nSingle-Leg Dumbbell Deadlift\n5\n5\n2 min.\n\n\nB1\nFarmer’s Walk\n5\n40 m.\n \n\n\nB2\nSledge Hammer Swing\n5\n20\n45 sec.\n\n\nC\nBurpee\n5\n15\n45 sec.\n\n\nD\n400-Meter Run\n6\n1\n1 min.\n\n\nDay 3\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA1\nBench\n3\n3,2,1\n \n\n\nA2\nBent-Over Row\n3\n10\n2 min.\n\n\nB1\nElbows Out Triceps Extension\n5\n10\n \n\n\nB2\nIncline Dumbbell Curl\n5\n12\n90 sec.\n\n\nC1\nCable Ab Twist\n5\n10\n30 sec.\n\n\nC2\n20-Meter Sprint, walk back to start\n10\n1\n \n\n\nD\n200-Meter Run\n10\n1\n30 sec.\n\n\nDay 4\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA1\nPower Clean or Snatch-Grip Deadlift\n8\n3\n \n\n\nA2\nBuddy Squat\n8\n10\n \n\n\nA3\n400-Meter Run\n8\n1\n \n\n\nA4\nChin-Up\n8\n15\n \n\n\nA5\nPush-Up\n8\n30\n3 min.\n\n\nDay 5\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA1\nFront Squat\n5\n3\n \n\n\nA2\nOverhead Press\n5\n3\n2 min.\n\n\nB1\nKettlebell Swing\n5\n8\n \n\n\nB2\nBox Jump\n5\n5\n \n\n\nB3\nBuddy Carry (no gear)\n5\n50 m.\n1 min.\n\n\nC\nFartlek/Interval Run\n1\n20 min.\n \n\n\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dip.jpg\" alt=\"Dip\" />\n\nDay 6\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA1\nDeadlift\n5\n1\n \n\n\nA2\nWeighted Chin-Up\n5\n5\n \n\n\nA3\nWeighted Dip\n5\n5\n \n\n\nA4\n25-Meter Sprint\n5\n1\n \n\n\nA5\nBuddy Squat\n5\n10\n \n\n\nA6\nBurpee\n5\n15\n \n\n\nA7\n200-Meter Run\n5\n1\n3 min.\n\n\nDay 7\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA1\nDumbbell Bench\n4\n6\n \n\n\nA2\nDumbbell Row\n4\n6\n90 sec.\n\n\nB1\nDumbbell Overhead Press\n3\n10\n \n\n\nB2\nDumbbell Curl\n3\n10\n \n\n\nB3\nDumbbell Shrug\n3\n20\n30 sec.\n\n\nC\nFartlek/Interval Run\n1\n25 min.\n \n\n\nDay 8\nNote: Everything done wearing flak jacket.\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA1\nKettlebell Swing\n5\n10\n \n\n\nA2\nAmmo Can Press\n5\n30\n \n\n\nA3\nChin-Up\n5\n10\n \n\n\nA4\nDip\n5\n10\n \n\n\nA5\nTire Flip\n5\n5\n \n\n\nA6\n400-Meter Run\n5\n1\n3 min.\n\n\nDay 9\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA1\nLunge\n5\n5\n \n\n\nA2\nOverhead Press\n5\n5\n90 sec.\n\n\nB\nCompound\n4\n6\n2 min.\n\n\n\nDeadlift, Row, Hang Clean, Push Press, Back Squat. 6 reps per movement.\n\n\nC\nBox Jump\n6\n4\n1 min.\n\n\nD\n100-Meter Run\n \n20\n30 sec.\n\n\nDay 10\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nSpeed Deadlift\n8\n3\n45 sec.\n\n\nB\nSquat\n3\n12\n2 min.\n\n\nC1\nSingle-Leg Box Jump\n6\n4\n \n\n\nC2\nTire Flip\n6\n4\n \n\n\nC3\nFarmer’s Walk\n6\n40 m.\n \n\n\nC4\nChin-Up\n6\n10\n \n\n\nC5\nPush-Up\n6\n20\n2 min.\n\n\nD\n800-Meter Run\n4\n1\n90 sec.\n\n\nWhat’s Your Excuse?\nThe men and women charged with defending our freedom face challenges most trainees will never have to face. However, we all can experience times of great stress, lack of sleep, tons of travel, poor nutrition, and inadequate workout facilities. Keep this program on hand for times when life starts threatening to knock you off your training game."
