"Here’s what you need to know…\n\nYour trapezius isn’t just that meaty part surrounding your neck. It extends from head to mid back.\nYour traps retract, depress, and help to upwardly rotate the scapula: all of which are heavily involved in weight training.\nWeak lower and middle traps will make you more vulnerable to upper body lifting injuries like shoulder impingement.\nDirect trap training works better than compound movements when it comes to hypertrophy.\nStrengthening the traps helps athletes avoid injury and it helps powerlifters increase their lifts.\n\nForm and Function\nFew things espouse more masculinity than a set of mountainous traps. But most lifters train their traps insufficiently from both an aesthetic and functional standpoint.\nThe trapezius plays critical roles in preventing shoulder and neck injuries as well as in pressing performance.\nTrapezius Function\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Trapezius-Anatomy.jpg\" alt=\"Trapezius Anatomy\" />\n \nThink the traps are just for shrugging?\nThe trapezius, originates from the external occipital protuberance (the back of your skull) and attaches to the ligamentum nuchae (your spine). It connects to the spinous processes behind the neck all the way down to the mid-back.\nThe upper traps, which many novice lifters wrongly assume is the entire muscle, inserts into the lateral third of the clavicle and into the acromion of the shoulder. It elevates the scapula for upward rotation.\nThe middle and lower traps join the rhomboids inserting into the spine of the scapula to retract them. It pulls the scapula back during movements such as rowing and climbing, and will enable a lifter to keep a stable upper back during horizontal and overhead pressing exercises.\nThe lower traps also assist with upward rotation of the scapula, which occurs anytime you raise your arms overhead.\nTrap Training: Hypertrophy Benefits\nLarger traps provide an illusionary effect. Check out the physiques on lightweight boxers, wrestlers, and mixed martial artists and you’ll see astounding upper trap development in spite of their low body weight.\nNovice lifters often say they’re getting enough trap work with deadlifts, rows, and squats, but when I’ve trained clients with hypertrophic goals in mind, the traps have immense growth potential that’s not realized without direct training. So why not train them directly?\nTrap Training: Performance Benefits\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Big-Traps.jpg\" alt=\"Big Traps\" />\n \nFor lifters with injury prevention in mind, such as athletes who engage in contact sports, trap training has crucial. Unresolved whiplash symptoms and chronic neck pain have been linked to trapezius weakness.\nWeaker trapezius muscles, specifically the middle and lower trapezius, can beget shoulder impingement syndrome, scapular winging, and scapular dyskinesis.\nTrap Training: Powerlifting Benefits\nRelevant to powerlifting or those desiring a bigger bench, shoulder impingement and dyskinesis will alter normal functioning of the glenohumeral joint, thus throwing a wrench in one’s bench-pressing progress.\nAlso, remember that stronger traps translate to bigger pulls. A lifter with strong lower traps will be able to pull the scapulae back and down during a deadlift or row, thus keeping the bar from traveling too far from the body. Strong upper traps will help lifters with their deadlift lockout, again keeping the bar closer to the body.\nTrap Training: Desk Jockey Benefits\nPaper pushers and online coaches need trap training too. Aside from just yoking-up their necks, trap training will give them better posture. It’ll help address scapular instability, and it’ll ward off the common upper back and neck pain associated with being anchored to a desk for the bulk of the work day.\nTrap Training Considerations\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bodybuilder-Traps.jpg\" alt=\"Bodybuilder Traps\" />\n \nPrioritize trap training. Do it at the beginning of your workout. Since these areas are never worked with high volume or to failure in strength programs, you won’t have to worry about their training affecting performance on subsequent lifts like the Olympic lifts or squats, presses, and rows.\nWhen I’ve had lifters train these groups through stretching and performing isometric holds, it’s been easier for them to get into a neutral neck position during lifts occurring later in the workout. And shrugging heavier loads in lower volumes will prime the CNS for the work that’s yet to come.\nUpper Trap Exercises\nNothing is more yawn-worthy than seeing “Barbell Shrug 3 x 10” in a workout program. If you have the flexibility in your program, or equipment, try these upper trap variations instead.\nDumbbell Jump Shrug\n \n\n\nBarbell Shrug Walk\n \n\n\nDumbbell Shrug Walk\n \n\n\nDumbbell Saw Shrug\n \n\n\nPlate Saw Shrug\n \n\n\nSeated One-Arm Dumbbell Shrug\n \n\n\nOne-Armed Smith Machine Shrug\n \n\n\nUnilateral Low Pulley Shoulder Extension Shrug\nNote: Unilateral shrugging exercises were found to produce the greatest EMG activity in the upper trapezius.\n \n\n\nBanded Lateral Raise to Shrug\n \n\n\nLower and Middle Trap Exercises\nFor the oft-neglected middle and lower aspects of the trapezius, throw these movements in along with your upper trap work:\nMini Range Lat Pull-Down to Isometric Hold\n \n\n\nVoyeur Shrug\n \n\n\nHalf T-Raise\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/half-t-raise.jpg\" alt=\"half-t-raise\" />\n\nThese work wonders in recruiting the middle and lower traps. EMG activity in the middle and lower trapezius is greatest during shoulder external rotation and flexion in the prone position.\nAlternating Forearm Wall Slide\n \n\n\nProne Tennis Ball Tension I, Y, T Raises\n \n\n\nStanding Calf Raise Shrug\n \n\n\nTrap Stretch\nAdd these to the end of your trap work for an intense stretch.\n \n\n\nTrap Workout Samples\nPre-training:\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\n4-Way Neck Machine\n2 *\n10\n\n\nB\nDumbbell Jump Shrugs\n2\n5\n\n\nC\nHeavy Barbell Shrugs / Rack Pulls\n3\n3\n\n\n * each direction\nPost-training:\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nProne Tennis Ball Tension Y, T, I Raises\n2\n5 *\n\n\nB\nWall Slide To Iso Hold\n2\n10\n\n\nC\nTrap Stretch\n2 * *\n10 – 20 sec.\n\n\n * each letter\n* * each side\nTrapezius Hypertrophy Workout:\nAdd this mini-session to your workouts twice weekly, performing them as a continuous rotation.
