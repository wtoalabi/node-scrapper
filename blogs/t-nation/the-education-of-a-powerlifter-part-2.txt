"Miss Part I of Tate’s tale? Check it out here.\n\n\nThe Program \nIt had been four months since Jonathan’s first visit to Tom’s gym. He\nwas beginning to become part of the crew and was eager to get on the same\nprogram as the rest of the guys. His body was now much bigger and stronger\nthan the first day he’d walked into the garage. He knew he was ready for\nthe intense training he’d been watching over the past several months.\n\nOver breakfast one Saturday, Tom reviewed how the program worked. \n“How are we going to get you strong, kid?” Tom asked. \n“I guess by following the program you’re going to give me, right?” Jonathan\nsaid. \nTom explained that a set program isn’t a bad thing, but to reach the\nhigher levels Jonathan would have to learn how to come up with his own\nprogram. The number one secret all top lifters know is that the best program\nfor them is the one they come up with, not the program someone\nhands to them on a piece of paper. \n“You see, to be the best you have to also be the best at figuring out\nwhat works for you. You have to be able to find and fix your weaknesses\nwhile always keeping your eyes on the higher goal,” Tom explained. \n\"But how do I know what my weak points are?\" Jonathan said.\n\nTom laughed as he dug into his mountain of food. “Your weak point right\nnow is you don’t know how to discover your weak points! So tell me, where\nwould you like to be five years from now?\" \nJonathan thought for a moment and replied that he’d like to have his\nElite status in the sport of powerlifting. \n“Okay,” Tom said, “At what weight class? What will your specific lifts\nhave to be? Let’s set some long range goals.” \nThey put together a plan that would have Jonathan lifting in the 275-pound\nweight class (he was currently 245) with an 800 pound squat, 500 pound\nbench press, and 700 pound deadlift. Jonathan felt great that he finally\nhad goals to shoot for, but he knew he had a very long way to go. Now,\nhow to get there. \nTom explained that there would be two days per week for max effort work\nand two days per week for dynamic effort training. The template would\nlook like this:\n\nMonday — Max\neffort squat and deadlift day\nWednesday — Max\neffort bench day \nFriday — Dynamic\neffort squat day and deadlift day\nSaturday — Dynamic\neffort bench day \n\n “The max effort days are intended to make you stronger,” Tom said, “while\nthe dynamic effort days are designed to make you faster. That’s it,\nnothing fancy. Strength plus speed equals new personal records.”\nJonathan was then handed a series of articles titled The\nEight Keys and was told to read them for the details. All he needed\nto know would be there. \nJonathan showed up to the gym on Monday fired up about the “Eight Keys”\narticle and wanted to start with the chains and bands. Tom turned to Jonathan\nand asked one very simple question: \n\"Can you compute the gravitational force exerted on a mass of two\npounds located five feet above the center of a circular disk with a radius\nof ten feet and mass of three pounds per unit of area?\"\nJonathan looked at him like he’d lost his mind. \"What does this\nhave to do with training?\" he thought. Tom went on to explain that\nyou can’t understand calculus without first understanding basic math.\nThe same is true with strength training. No need for chains and bands\nuntil you get the basics down first. \n“But don’t I have to use chains and bands to get strong?” Jonathon asked.\n\n“No,” Tom replied, “You have to get strong to use chains and bands! Chains\nand bands aren’t the program; they’re only a function of the program.\nYou first must understand the program. The first thing for you is to build\na strong base of strength to the point where you can get on a platform\nand display it.”\n“Okay,” said Jonathon. “I get it.” \n“Good. Now let’s talk about the methods that’ll make up your program\nin basic terms you’ll understand.”\n\nThe Method to the Madness\nTo explain the dynamic effort method, Tom asked Jonathan to jump onto\na small box. Jonathan did this with no problem. Next, Tom asked that he\nrepeat the jump again but this time he had to jump in slow motion. It\ndidn’t take Jonathan long to learn this was impossible to do. \n“That’s right,” Tom said. “You gotta have speed to generate force. The\ngood news is this is a component that can be trained. This is what the\ndynamic effort method is for.”\nThey moved on to what Tom called the max effort method. He set up a 50-inch\nbox and asked Jonathan to jump onto it. Jonathan looked confused. \n“I need to be faster to get up there,” Jonathan said. \n“No, for you to get way up there you’ll have to get stronger.\nWe can make you very fast but as long as your strength stays the same\nyou’ll only improve your current strength level. Let me explain it this\nway: you may be strong enough to jump to 21 but now are only fast enough\nfor 18 inches. Speed will help you get to 21 but to go higher your strength\nwill have to increase. This is where the max effort method comes in. See,\nthere’s a need for both speed and strength to be developed at the\nsame time.”\nJonathan’s max effort work consisted of the following movements:\n\n1. Good mornings with\nvarious bars (cambered, buffalo and safety squat). \n2. Low box squats with\nvarious bars.\n3. Various deadlifts:\nstanding on mats, pin pull and off-the-floor.  \n\n Jonathan’s dynamic squat wave was set up in three-week cycles. He\nalso used a box squat set at parallel for all sets:\n\nWeek one: 8 sets of\n2 reps with 50%\nWeek two: 8 sets of\n2 reps with 55%\nWeek three: 8 sets\nof 2 reps with 60%\n\n On all the days where he felt good and the speed was on, Jonathan did\na few extra sets after the first eight sets and added weight on each one.\nThese were never taken to failure, but were heavy enough to get a good\nfeel for where his strength base was. After the three weeks the cycle\nwas repeated. \nJonathan’s dynamic bench wave was set on a flat cycle using 50%\n for eight sets of three reps. On all the days where he felt good and the\nspeed was on, Jonathan did a few extra sets, same rules as above. \n\nLeave Jonathan at Home \nAfter some time, Jonathan began to understand the importance of speed\nand strength but needed to know more. He had to know what to do after\nthe main exercise of the day. He remembered Tom telling him about the\nweaknesses several of the lifters had and what they were doing with their\naccessory work to overcome them. \nThe problem was, he had no idea what his weaknesses were and had no way\nto find out how to fix them. All he knew was that he was still much weaker\nthan everyone else, so he figured everything was weak and he needed\nto do everything . He was totally lost.\nLater that day they were all doing low box squats with the cambered bar.\nJonathan was fired up for this as it would be the first time he was doing\na max effort movement for a second rotation. His max effort movement was\nset up to rotate every three weeks and would later come down to every\nweek like the rest of the guys. \nThe objective of his first week was to get used to the movement for sets\nof three reps. The second week’s objective was to set a one rep max\nwhile the third was a \"balls to the wall\" strain lift. He accomplished\na 275 max during his first rotation with the cambered bar and was geared\nup to break this record. His warm-ups went well as he completed three\nreps with the bar and then 95, 135, 185, and 225 pounds. He then dropped\nto singles and completed the following sets with 245, 265 and then a record\nat 285 pounds! \nHe was jacked up about this and was ready to quit for the day when he\nheard the loud slam of a 45 plate on the bar. He was called to the bar\nand noticed three 45’s on each side. The crew shouted, \"You’re up!\"\n\nJonathan felt the adrenaline running through his veins and rage beginning\nto build up inside. As he approached the bar he heard the battle cries\nfrom the crew: “Get this bitch!”, “You got it!”, “Get ya some!”, “Kill\nthis mother!”, “Get tight!” and “Come on, J!”\nHe lifted the bar out of the rack and felt the load bearing down. As\nhe sat to the box the rage kept building. He paused for one second and\nbegan to stand up. He left the box fast and at the mid-point began to\nstall. \"Up, Up, Up!\" and \"Head up!\" is all he heard.\nHe pushed with all he had and the bar kept moving. He felt the pressure\nbuilding in his head. His back, legs, and torso felt incredibly strained,\nbut he pushed on. \nWhen he racked the bar he opened his eyes to see silver lights floating\naround. He first thought it was chalk in the air but then realized it\nlooked more like glitter. Then he realized he was seeing stars for the\nfirst time in his life. He turned to Tom with bloodshot eyes and a huge\ngrin on his face and said simply, \"Holy cow.\" \n\"Welcome to the world of powerlifting,” Tom said. “Today you became\n‘J.’ and Jonathan is a thing of the past. From now on leave Jonathan at\nhome and bring J. to the gym every workout. He’s the one who’ll take you\nwhere you want to go.\" Jonathan was no longer a guy who “worked out.”\nHe was a lifter. \nAfter the max, J. was pretty messed up the rest of the day and could\nonly manage to do some glute ham raises and ab work. He asked how he was\nsupposed to do all the other work for the day. Tom told him he was done\nand that he had to learn to listen to his body. \n“So what are my weak points?” J. asked. \nTom explained to J. that weak point training was a very advanced concept\nand that he just needed to focus on bringing up the basics for now. For\nthe squat and deadlift these included training for the hamstrings, lower\nback, and abs. The bench press movements should target the triceps, delts,\nand lats. \n“This may seem very simple, but just do the basics and your lifts will\njump,” Tom said. As time went on, Tom would teach him that the best way\nto find weak points was to look at where the lifts break down during max\neffort lifts. With The Eight Keys\nPart III and the crew’s help, he’d be able to bring up these weak\npoints and his lifts would go through the roof. \n\nThe Payback\nJ. kept training and breaking records with the crew for the next two\nyears. With newfound motivation and determination, he went back to school\nto become a strength coach. He could no longer train with the crew as\nthe university of his choice was hours away from home, but he kept training\nand entering local powerlifting meets for the next five years while he\nearned his degree. \nJ. was then offered an assistant strength and conditioning coach position\nand over the next six years worked his way up to being the head S &\nC coach. The methods he learned from the crew have been the core of his\ntraining programs and the results were amazing. J. would call Tom from\ntime to time for the first few years after he left, but then lost touch\nwith him and the crew. \nTom, now retired from competition, has moved the gym from his garage\nto a small private training center. His center has been producing great\nlifters for the past eleven years. Tom’s main goal with all his lifters\nwas to help them achieve their elite status, hoping they’d pass on what\nthey’d learned to the next generation of lifters. \nHis crew was now gearing up for the Nationals. Tom remembered the last\ntime the Nationals were in his hometown twelve years ago. This was one\nof the best competitive days of his life, the day he’d set the federation\nworld record for the 275 class. \nThe Nationals were a great meet for Tom’s crew and, with no lifters\nin the last round, he found himself relaxing in the back row watching\nthe deadlifts. The first round of guys took their opening attempts and\nthe final lifter’s opener was 100 pounds over the next guy. He didn’t\nknow the lifter’s name but the guy was \"jacked\" and had perfect\nform. \nThe loud speaker crackled, “The next attempt will be for a new 275 pound\nclass world record!” \nThe crowd stood and Tom could feel the adrenaline building up inside\nhim. Sure, his record was at risk, but this was what people train their\nentire lives for. Through the chalk and dust emerged the \"jacked\"\nlifter. He had a look of determination and a thousand yard stare that\nonly another powerlifter could understand. As he chalked his hands and\nmade his way top to bar, Tom could hear the lifter’s helpers shouting\nwords of encouragement: \"Back tight!\", \"Tight grip!\",\n\"Shoulders back!\", “Get some!”, and \"Come on, J.!”\nThat last one hit Tom like a ton of bricks. He was taken back twelve\nyears ago where he first met Jonathan at this very meet. Tom looked very\nclose at the lifter as he approached the bar and realized that this was\nthe same kid he’d helped bring into the sport so many years back. Now,\nthe “kid” was here and going after his record. Tom jumped up onto his\nchair so he didn’t miss a thing. \nJ. grabbed the bar and began to pull. Veins began popping out all over\nhis frame. The weight rocked off the floor and began to stall right above\nhis knees. The crowd was going nuts and everyone was now on their chairs.\nJ. kept pulling with everything he had. This was exactly what he\ngot into the sport for. \nThe barbell kept moving inch by inch until he stood at lockout with the\nhuge load in his hands. \"Down!\" the head judge shouted. J. held\nthe bar for a few extra seconds to savor the moment. He’d finally realized\none of his longtime dreams! \nTom had to make his way back to the warm-up room to congratulate J. for\nthe awesome lift. As he approached, Tom noticed a young novice lifter\nspeaking with J. \n\"Sir, that was a great pull,\" said the kid. “I didn’t do so\nwell myself. This was my first meet and I really don’t know what I’m doing\nyet.” \nJ. looked the kid up and down and took out a piece of paper and handed\nit to him. \n\"My name’s J. and this is my direct phone number. Give me a call\nanytime and I’ll help you set up a program for your next meet.\" \nThe kid thanked him and walked away with a look of hope and excitement\nin his eyes. One of the other lifters looked at J. and said, \"That\nwas smart. Now that kid will be calling you everyday.\" \nJ. looked at the lifter. \"I hope so. Someone took the time to help\nme once. It’s what makes powerlifting such a great sport.” \nTom heard the whole thing and recognized this for what it was: the greatest\ngift he’s ever been given. J. had become a champion powerlifter and had\nlearned more along the way than just how to bring up his weak points.\n\nTom made his way over. “You still pulling that sled around every day,\nJ.?” \nJ. looked up and his mouth fell open. “Tom! It’s great to see you, man,\nit’s been a long time! I’ve been wanting to get in touch with you again\nfor years to thank you for what all you did for me.” \n“It was no big deal,” Tom said. \nThat’s when J. told Tom the story of how he’d been at the end of his\nrope twelve years before, how he’d quit school and started sleeping all\nday and drinking and drugging all night. \n“You took the time to help me out,” J. said. “You gave me something to\nlive for. Training is great, but I also have a great job and family now.\nYou and the crew were a big influence on my life and I can only hope to\nrepay you for this someday.”\nTom looked at J. “You’ve already paid me back more than you’ll ever know.”\n\nAnd that’s how a real powerlifter gets educated. \n\nFor more info and products from Dave Tate, visit Elite Fitness Systems\nat www.eliteFTS.com."
