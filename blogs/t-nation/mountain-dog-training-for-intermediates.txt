"As the creator of the Mountain Dog training system, even I’ll admit that it can be a little brutal.\nI’ve received hundreds of hateful emails and profanity-laced text messages over the years from readers and clients telling me that\nMountain Dog leg training left them too sore to walk up a flight of stairs or even sit on the toilet.\nAnd for the last time, no, I do not own stock in any brand of adult diaper.\nThis has led many to label Mountain Dog an “advanced” training system, intended for guys who’ve exhausted most traditional methods.\nI basically agree, as like in dieting, it only makes sense to “try to get the most out of the least.”\nIn other words, why hit a balls-out Mountain Dog leg workout and have to be wheeled out of the gym on a gurney when a simple linear\nprogression program of basic exercises will work?\nBut then there’s the huge category of so-called “intermediate lifters.” These guys are bigger and stronger than the fresh-faced\nbeginners, but not developed enough to do damage on a bodybuilding stage or powerlifting platform. Are these guys ready for Mountain\nDog? Maybe, maybe not.\nTo that end, here’s how I classify beginner, intermediate, and advanced lifters:\nBeginner\n\nLess than two years in the gym.\nStrength is poor. Can’t bench press or squat their own bodyweight.\nNot coordinated enough to do heavy compound movements well. Require plenty of hands on guidance.\nOften can’t feel target muscles working.\nCan’t understand most cues such as “tuck your elbows in” or “lift your sternum up.”\nPhysiques can vary considerably, but usually will show very little muscle belly fullness or roundness, vascularity, or striations. Might even be skinny fat.\n\nIntermediate\n\nUsually two years plus in the gym.\nDecent at executing the basic heavy compound movements.\nCan feel most muscles working well.\nUnderstands most verbal exercise cues.\nStrength is decent. Can likely do a few reps with bodyweight on bench presses (or within 30 pounds of bodyweight for females), and their weight plus 100 pounds in the squat with good form for a few reps (or bodyweight plus 25 pounds for females).\nPhysiques show signs of good development, usually described as “athletic.” They might have some muscle groups that are lean with some decent size and fullness. Again, this can vary considerably.\n\nAdvanced\n\nFive years plus in the gym.\nVery good at executing the basic heavy compound movements. Understands how to use machines and align their body to target specific muscles.\nUnderstands the little things, such as proper elbow trajectory in a row. Good kinesthetic awareness.\nHave done drop sets, supersets, and other high intensity techniques successfully.\nMentally tough, as they’ve pushed themselves hard to bust through plateaus.\nCan feel most muscles working well.\nVery good at interpreting verbal cues.\nPhysiques can vary, but you might see some striations and vascularity, along with some “under the radar” muscle development such as hamstrings and rear delts\n\nMore on Beginners\nSo to round up, insanity is not required if you’re a beginner. Strive to master the basics such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, leg presses, barbell curls, triceps pushdowns, etc. You’ll get bigger and stronger just by doing the basics and focusing on pushing up the weights or reps.\nFocus should be kept on beating your logbook and executing perfect form. Don’t let the need to push more weight dictate form – it should be constant and near perfect. Keep it simple and grow!\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dumbbell-chest-exercise.jpg\" alt=\"dumbbell-chest-exercise\" />\n\nThe Next Step: Welcome to Intermediate Mountain Dog Land.\nSo now it’s time to ramp up the volume and intensity to superhuman levels, right? Not so fast. At this stage I’m going to challenge you a bit more with some high intensity sets and work your volume up some, but not to advanced levels.\nHere’s my simple way of explaining the main difference between advanced and intermediate training.\nVolume\nVolume is less for intermediates. See the chart below for a typical 12-week program model:\n\n\n \nPhase 1 (weeks 1-3)\nPhase 2 (weeks 4-9)\nPhase 3 (weeks 10-12)\n\n\nIntermediate\n6-8 sets *\n8-12 sets *\n6-8 sets *\n\n\nAdvanced\n9-12 sets *\n12-20 sets *\n7-10 sets *\n\n\n * depending on size of bodypart.\nWhy such a moderate approach? Again, it’s all about getting the most out of the least. The intermediate program is a step up from what a beginner would do but not as much as an advanced. This is still extra stress and muscle breakdown that will set the stage for continued gains.\nWhat about the deloads?\nFor advanced programs, I advise that you go light for a week or take a week off completely if you think you need it. If you’ve executed the program properly, you’ll probably need a break of some kind.\nFor intermediate programs, a deload usually isn’t necessary. Although you’re being pushed harder, you’re not being pushed to the brink of overtraining or even overreaching, for that matter.\nWhat about training frequency?\nFor advanced trainees I often build five-day or even six-day training programs. Advanced athletes usually have their supplements and diets more dialed-in than intermediates, which is another factor that allows them to push harder and longer.\nIntermediates will not train more than the standard four days per week. This helps build conditioning and develop good training and lifestyle habits. Shape your habits now, as they’ll become a necessity when you’re ready to step it up to the advanced level.\nExercise Rotation\nFor advanced programs, I never schedule the same workout twice in a row. At this point in your training you have to constantly find ways to shock the body. The “keep it simple” motto that brought you to the advanced level is no longer the best choice for staying ahead of the adaptation curve.\nFor intermediates, we’ll keep a basic core movement in the workout in the same place (usually the second exercise performed). We’ll change the execution of it, but it will be there every week.\nHere are a few examples:\nIntermediate Chest Workout Week 1 (8 working sets)\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nIncline Dumbbell Press *\n3\n8\n\n\nB\nIncline Barbell Press * *\n4\n12, 10, 8, 6\n\n\nC\nDumbbell Twist Press\n3\n10\n\n\n\n* after pyramiding up to a heavy weight\n* * the last 2 sets are considered working sets\nIntermediate Chest Workout Week 2 (8 working sets)\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nDecline Dumbbell Press *\n3\n10\n\n\nB\nIncline Barbell Press * *\n4\n10, 8, 6, 4\n\n\nC\nLadder Push-Ups\n2\nfailure\n\n\nD\nPec Minor Dips\n1\nfailure\n\n\n\n* after pyramiding up to a heavy weight\n* * the last 2 sets are considered working sets\nYou can see the basic exercise remains in the #2 position. It will likely stay there throughout the program, with only some minor variances in how many reps to execute and the form used.\nThis lets the trainee maintain focus on a good basic exercise and affords them a means to gauge their strength. Eventually they’ll graduate to the advanced level and the poundages lifted will still be important but not as important as the intensity generated during the set.\nCompare this to two weeks of an advanced program:\nAdvanced Chest Workout Week 1 (10 working sets)\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nIncline Dumbbell Press *\n4\n8\n\n\nB\nIncline Barbell Press * *\n5\n12, 10, 8, 7, 6\n\n\nC\nDumbbell Twist Press\n3\n10\n\n\n\n* after pyramiding up to a heavy weight\n* * the last 3 sets are considered working sets\nAdvanced Chest Workout Week 2 (12 working sets)\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nDecline Dumbbell Press *\n3\n10 *\n\n\nB\nReverse Band Bench Press * *\n5\n5\n\n\nC\nLadder Push-Ups\n2\nfailure\n\n\nD\nPec Minor Dips\n2\nfailure\n\n\n\n* after pyramiding up to a heavy weight\n* * pyramid using a 5 x 5 rep scheme\nAs you can see, the entire selection of exercises changed the second week, and will change again the third week.\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dumbbell-incline.jpg\" alt=\"dumbbell-incline\" />\n\nIntensity\nWith intermediates I begin to slowly work more intensity into their programs for a little extra push as the program progresses.\nAs you can see in the chart below, the main difference between intermediate and advanced trainees is in Phase 2. I believe in throwing everything but the kitchen sink at advanced athletes during this phase, but hold back a bit with intermediates as they’re typically just getting used to doing high intensity techniques on a weekly basis.\n\n\n \nPhase 1 (weeks 1-3)\nPhase 2 (weeks 4-9)\nPhase 3 (weeks 10-12)\n\n\nIntermediate\n6-8 sets *\n One of these sets might be a drop-set, a rest-pause set, a set with additional partials, etc.\n This is setting the stage for Phase 2.\n8-12 sets *\n Two or three of these sets might be a drop-set, a brutal rest-pause set, a set with additional partials, etc.\n This is setting the stage for Phase 3.\n We’ve upped the intensity from Phase 1, but done it logically and slowly.\n6-8 sets *\n Two or three of these will be very high intensity.\n There are less overall sets to facilitate recovery from Phase 2, which should have been very difficult.\n This lower volume period is when most grow the most.\n\n\nAdvanced\n9-12 sets *\n Two or three of these sets might be a drop-set, a rest-pause set, a set with additional partials, etc.\n12-20 sets *\n 4-10 of these sets might be a drop-set, rest-pause sets, a set with additional partials, etc.\n This is gut busting time. My goal is to take you right to the edge of overreaching and maybe just past and reel you back in.\n7-10 sets *\n Two of these sets might be a drop-set, rest-pause sets, a set with additional partials, etc.\n Again, this is where most see good growth, as we’re allowing the body to grow from Phase 2 with a little less volume.\n\n\n\n* depending on size of bodypart.\nBandwork\nIf used correctly, bands are a great way to add intensity to your training. They’re not often used in the bodybuilding world, but I’ve\nadapted them to fit a hypertrophy model. I also like to use chains when available.\n\n\n \nPhase 1 (weeks 1-3)\nPhase 2 (weeks 4-9)\nPhase 3 (weeks 10-12)\n\n\nIntermediate\nNo band work\nA few sets of band work, primarily to learn the technique and to get some added intensity.\nNo band work\n\n\nAdvanced\nNo band work\nSix weeks of very structured band work with increasing loads every week. Six weeks will take you to the brink of overreaching or beyond if done correctly.\nNo band work\n\n\nFinal Thoughts on Intermediates\nWhile this article is training-based, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the value of proper nutrition and supplementation.\nThe more advanced the program gets, the higher your training intensity and volume will be. Your body needs fuel; it needs high quality food and in some cases supplements to deliver maximal results.\nTraining and nutrition must always receive equal attention if outstanding results are to be achieved. If your nutrition is bad, I promise you my program will not accomplish much except teach you some cool exercises. If your nutrition is first class, you’ll see results, I guarantee.\nMoving on from beginner to intermediate is a major steppingstone as it’s where the dedicated bodybuilders start to distance themselves from the many recreational lifters. But jumping from a basic routine to a full-tilt Mountain Dog assault is unwise, unnecessary, and counterproductive.\nTry some of these intermediate steps and take your physique one step closer to the advanced level!"
