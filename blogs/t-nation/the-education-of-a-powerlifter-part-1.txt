"Want to know how to become a powerlifter? Believe me, there’s\nno \"Powerlifting for Dummies\" book at your local Wal-mart. Being\na powerlifter is a strange blend of mysticism, drive, strength, and a\nlittle bit of crazy. To be one you’ve got to want it bad; got to\nwant it so bad that you’re willing to devote years to its pursuit.\nStill, as rough as it is, those that are indoctrinated into its strange\nworld rarely leave.\nThis is part 1 of a story about one man’s journey\ninto the cult of powerlifting.\n\nJonathan Among The Giants\nWhen Jonathan walked into the hotel lobby he found himself among giants.\nHuge men milled around the room, all of them looking like they lifted\nboulders for a living. What was going on here? Some type of professional\nwrestling event? A casting call for a gladiator or barbarian movie? Jonathan\nhad never seen anything like it. \nHe’d come to the hotel to meet a friend for lunch, but as they ate all\nhe could do was stare at these powerful looking leviathans. Finally, he\nasked the waiter what was going on. \n“Powerlifters,” the waiter said. “And we’re running out of food.”\nAfter lunch, Jonathan walked out of the restaurant and noticed a commotion\ncoming from the hotel’s grand ball room. Peeking through the door he saw\nhundreds of people cheering these giants on. He paid the entry fee and\nfound a place in the back of the room to watch what he thought was called\nthe “deadlift event.” \nLifter after lifter would approach the bar with a crazed look of intensity\nand pull with his greatest effort. Each pull would finish with the lifter\neither making the weight or missing it, but either way they all had a\nlook of pride and accomplishment. \nJonathan didn’t really know what was going on here. He’d never attended\na powerlifting meet before. He knew only one thing: this was coolest thing\nhe’d ever seen. \n\nTom Gets His Total\n\"For the final deadlift of the day, we have a world record attempt,\"\nthe loud speaker announced. Tom approached the bar. He’d trained his whole\nlife for this moment. Weighing in at a ripped 275 pounds, Tom was ready\nto go. \nWith a look of controlled rage on his face, he approached the bar and\nbegan to pull with everything he had. The bar slowly left the ground as\nthe crowd all got to its feet, some standing on chairs, some standing\nin the isle, all cheering as loud as they could. To Jonathan, the scene\nwas unreal. \nTom kept pulling. The tension in his back and hands was insane but he\nknew if he just stayed with it the lift would be his. Seconds later he\nwas standing with the bar locked out and heard the head official say \"down.\"\nIt wasn’t until the bar hit the ground that he noticed the roar of the\ncrowd. The lift was his; the day was his. This, he thought, is\nwhat it’s all about. \nWhen the meet was over, the lifters made their way back into the warm-up\nroom to exchange stories about the day’s battles. Some were excited about\ntheir new records; other were disappointed but were already planning their\nnext training cycles. They had all put in countless hours in the gym for\nthis and wanted to extend it as much as they could. \nTom sat in a circle of chairs with friends and training partners. This\nwas Tom’s day. He’d hit a record squat, bench and deadlift —\nthe biggest total of his life. All the pain, injuries, sacrifices and\ntraining hours finally seemed worth it. \n“What’s next?” asked one of Tom’s training partners. \nTom didn’t have to think about his answer. “It’s back in the gym\nMonday. I know I have more left in me.” This is what he said after every\nmeet, what top powerlifters always say. For them, satisfaction\nisn’t an option. When you become satisfied, you become obsolete.\n\n\nThe Decision\nJonathon couldn’t believe what he was feeling. Halfway through the giant’s\nlift, he’d found himself up on his chair screaming encouragement to a\nman he’d never met. \nWhen the event was over he knew one thing for certain: he had to become\npart of this. \nJonathon was never an athlete in high school and hadn’t done anything\nfitness related since he graduated from college a year ago. He did work\nout from time to time in college but nothing with any structure or consistency.\nAt his best he was about 185 pounds at 5’11” with a personal best bench\npress of around 250, but that was years ago. He loved what he’d just witnessed\nbut had no idea where to begin. It was then he made a decision: he had\nto talk to the giant. \nMaking his way to the back room, he had no idea what he would say. What\nwould these huge men say to him? Would they laugh and kick him out of\nthe room? Would they make fun of him? Jonathan didn’t know, but he had\nto try. \nHe found Tom packing up his bag. Hesitantly, Jonathan asked, \"Excuse\nme, but how does one get involved in the sport of powerlifting?\"\n\nTom and the other lifters turned to look at him. Jonathan couldn’t help\nbut feel he was being sized up. \n“How serious are you?” Tom asked. \n“Pretty serious, I guess,” Jonathan said. “That was, well, the greatest\nthing I’ve ever seen.” He waited for the giants to laugh at him. They\ndidn’t. \nTom took out a piece of paper and scribbled some notes on it. Sweat was\nstill running off his bald head as he handed Jonathan the paper. \"Meet\nus here Monday at 5:00.” he said. “This is my gym.” \n\nShut Up and Spot\nJonathan couldn’t sleep at all Sunday night anticipating the Monday training\nsession. He was now going to be a powerlifter. Time couldn’t go fast enough\nMonday, but 5:00 did finally roll around. He was fired up to finally be\njoining a gym. \nAs he drove through the commercial developments, he kept looking for\nthe neon sign for Tom’s gym. The businesses soon turned into residential\nneighborhoods and he began to wonder why Tom would ask him to pick him\nup at his house. He pulled into Tom’s driveway and honked the horn.\nAfter a few minutes he began to wonder if Tom was home. Then it dawned\non him that maybe he’d been blown off and sent on some kind of wild goose\nchase. \nIn a last attempt, Jonathan got out of the car to go ring the doorbell.\nAs he walked toward the house he heard loud metal music coming from the\ngarage. Tom must be working on his car or something, Jonathan thought.\nWhen he walked through the door, he couldn’t believe what he saw. This\nwas Tom’s gym. He had no idea what the equipment was but there was\nnothing in there like he used in college. \n\"Hey, we thought you weren’t coming!\" Tom shouted above the\nmusic. There were about seven guys crowded around a power rack. They were\ndoing some strange movement in the rack with some type of yolk bar suspended\nby chains. \"One more rep!\" shouted Tom as the lifter’s face\nturned beet red under the strain. \nJonathan couldn’t believe how great this was. The bar was loaded with\nmore weight than he’d ever seen. These guys were crazy strong and he couldn’t\nwait to become one of them. He walked over to Tom and asked what he should\ndo. \n“Your job today is to spot and keep your mouth shut,” Tom said. \nJonathan spent the rest of the day loading the bar for all the other\nlifters. This was still one of the best days of his life. When the session\nwas over, Jonathan was in awe. This place was hardcore, these guys were\nhardcore and the weights were certainly hardcore. When the last lifter\nwas done Jonathan was ready to learn how to be strong. With little conversation\nall the lifters packed up the gear and left. Jonathan was left with Tom\nand asked again what he should do. \n“Go home,” Tom replied. “Come back Wednesday.” \nJonathan knew instinctively not to argue. He drove home still psyched\nup over the day’s events but wondered why he didn’t train. Two more weeks\npassed and Jonathan still hadn’t touched a weight. He’d asked a few times\nwhat he should do and the lifters kept telling him to shut up and spot.\nHe began to wonder if he was brought in only to load the weights. But\nhe was still excited to be there and was having a great time. The weights\nthese guys were moving were unreal! It was a privilege to be there. \nThe last time he asked Tom when he could lift, Tom told him flat out\nthat he wasn’t ready. Jonathan was a bit set back. He really wanted to\nbe a powerlifter and all he was doing was spotting. This continued on\nfor another week. He was now bored out of his skull. As he sat in silence\nat the end of one of their bench sessions, Tom walked over and said, \"Now\nyou’re ready.\"\n\"Why now?\" Jonathon asked. \nTom explained that when he came in he was in awe of the lifters in the\ngroup and that you can never become what you’re in awe of. \n“It’s okay to have idols as a kid,” Tom said, “but when you grow up you\nhave to become what you dream about.” \nThen he said something Jonathan would remember for the rest of his life.\n\"We know what we can do for you; what we really want to know is,\nwhat can you do for us?\" \nJonathan understood. They already had all the spotters they needed. What\nthey really wanted were lifters. Jonathan was about to become one. \n\nBecoming Bullet Proof \nMonday rolled around and from the past weeks’ experience Jonathan figured\nout this was a lower body, heavy day. As he drove to the gym he wondered\nwhat they would have him do today. He arrived early at 4:30 and found\na few of the guys were already there. Some of them were doing extra abdominal\nmovements, some were dragging a sled and others were stretching out. The\none thing that stood out is that they were all doing something different.\nHe would have to ask Tom about this. \nTom finally got there and they all agreed to do some type of good morning\nmovement. Jonathan had no idea what this was but was game for anything.\nA couple of the guys placed the bar on their back and began to bend over\nat the waist. He figured this was pretty easy and took his place in the\nline up. As he walked up to the bar Tom asked, \"What the hell are\nyou doing?\" \n“Good mornings,” Tom said. \n“No,” Tom said, “you’re not. You aren’t ready. Come with me.” \nThey walked out back and Jonathan was given a weight belt attached to\na sled with a couple of plates on it. \"Drag this for ten trips down\nto the tree and back, then come get me,\" Tom said. \nWhile he really wanted to train like the other guys, at least he wasn’t\nspotting and loading the bar. After a few trips he could feel his legs\ngetting tired and it was getting harder and harder to breathe. He’d do\na set, rest, then do another. He could hear the intensity of the session\ngoing on inside and wished he was part of it. After he finished, he went\nback into the gym. \nThe guys were now into their top sets and he walked over to Tom and asked\nwhat to do next. Tom told him to spot and he’d get with him after they\nfinished. Jonathan spent the next ten minutes watching the guys just about\nblow their heads off under the strain of the good mornings. Jonathon asked\nTom why he was spotting again. “Everyone spots with the big weights,”\nTom replied. “This is part of your job. No one is above spotting and coaching\nhere!” \nWhen the movement was over, the guys split up and began doing different\nexercises. Once again he wondered why they all did different things. Jonathan\nwas told to do five sets of something called reverse hypers. He was positioned\non a bench with a strap attached around his ankles. He began to swing\nthe weight up and was told to arch as hard as he could at the top. He\ncouldn’t use much weight at all. The other guys were using around 500\npounds but all he could use was 50. When he finished his lower back felt\ntied up in knots. \nNext he did incline sit-ups and straight leg raises. He did five sets\nof each with coaching coming from many different lifters. He was taught\nhow to flex and tighten his abs. From time to time they would come over\nand push their fingers into his abs to make sure they were being held\ntight. \nThe last movement he was asked to do was called “band good mornings.”\nFor this he stood on a big rubber band, placed the other end around the\nback of his traps, bent over at the waist and then stood up. He was told\nto try and feel the movement in his lower back and hamstrings. He could\nfeel it alright.\n\n\"Crap\" Work \nWhile he thought he’d be sore, he actually felt pretty good. He couldn’t\nwait for Wednesday’s heavy bench press session. When he got to the\ngym he was told once again to hit the sled for ten trips. When he came\nback in the guys were doing a bench press movement where they would lower\nthe bar down to a couple of boards and press back up. He couldn’t wait\nto give this a shot as he was sure he could handle some decent weight.\n\nTo his surprise he was told to do band good mornings and abs again. When\nhe was finished with this he was told to do 100 push-ups and to do them\nin as many sets as it would take. He had to use good form and with his\nhands placed on a pair of hex dumbbells. His grip width had to be in the\nsame position he’d eventually bench in. \nThis was followed up with some work for the rotator cuff and rear shoulders.\nJonathan was told that this would be his workout for the next month and\nthat he was to try and do more weight and/or reps on each training session\nthereafter. \nTwo weeks passed and he was ready to do some of the movements the other\nguys were doing. Tom wouldn’t budge. The kid had to stick to the plan.\nOnce again he was getting frustrated with this training plan and began\nto wonder if these guys really knew what they were doing. He already knew\nthat none of them did the same thing. Finally, he asked Tom why he had\nto do all the \"crap\" work and why no one else was doing it.\nHe wanted to be a powerlifter and all he was doing was “sissy” movements.\n\n\"You see Jim over there?” Tom said. “Jim has weak glutes and is\ndoing extra work for them. This is what he needs to do to get his deadlift\nto go up. You see Matt over there? Matt’s doing extra lower back work.\nHe needs to make his back stronger to keep the bar in a better position\nwhen he squats. And Mike over there? Mike’s doing extra ab work to help\nwith his transfer of power out of the hole when he squats. You\nneed to do conditioning work to be able to handle the work we’ll ask you\nto do later. You’ll never be 100% injury free, but you better be prepared\nto handle the strain.” \n\nTechnique, Technique, Technique \nIt had been six weeks since Jonathan’s first conditioning session and\nhe was eager to begin \"real powerlifting.\" This was the day\nhe’d waited for. \nAs he walked into the gym he saw the guys were setting the rack up to\ndo high box, Manta Ray squats. Jonathan was ready to walk up to the rack\nwhen he was stopped in his tracks by Mark. Mark was one of the best squatters\nin the gym and pulled him aside to let him know he wasn’t going to be\ndoing box squats today. Today he was going to squat and squat correctly.\n\nMark took Jonathan aside and first explained how to do a squat with perfect\nform; next they watched a few Westside videos detailing squat form. Mark\nthen explained that to fully learn how to squat, Jonathan had to first\nunderstand the squat. This is accomplished by hearing the squat\nexplained, then seeing it done properly, then doing it so many times it\nbecomes automatic. \nJonathan was handed a broomstick and given the instructions:\n\n1. Place the bar on\nthe center of your back.\n2. Squeeze your hands\non the bar as hard as you can.\n3. Pull your shoulder\nblades together and make sure your upper back is tight.\n4. Pull your head up\nand drive it back into your traps.\n5. Stand with your\nfeet out wide.\n6. Push your feet out\nto the sides of your shoes.\n7. Force your knees\nout to the side.\n8. Arch your lower\nback as hard as you can.\n9. Keep your abs tight.\n\n There were a few other steps but all Jonathan could remember is doing\nrep after rep while Mark barked at him to squat back and sit on the bench.\n\"Squat back?\" he said, “I’m already tired!” \n“Look, man,” Mark said, “you’ll never squat 100%; none of us do. The\nkey is to get as close as you can. Right now you’re at 0% and are piss\nass weak. Now squat!”\nRep after rep they worked on form. Jonathan must’ve performed 300 reps\nthat day and actually made his way up to using a 45-pound bar. The weight\nwasn’t a problem, but Mark wouldn’t let him use more as long as his form\nwas sub-par. After what seemed to be 45 minutes of squatting he was told\nto move onto reverse hypers and ab work, then finish with the sled for\na few trips. \nBy this time Jonathan was pretty fond of the sled and asked if he should\ndo more. From the corner of the gym Bob shouted, \"Oh no! Not another\nMr. GPP!\" Tom then pulled Jonathan aside and explained that GPP,\nGeneral Physical Preparedness, is very important but you don’t compete\nin GPP. What Jonathan really needed was optimal conditioning for powerlifting\nand anything too much over that is pointless. \nAbout this time there was a knock on the door. Tom answered it and turned\naround with a huge grin on his face. It seemed Tom had ordered a new piece\nof equipment and it was here! This was not just any piece of equipment\nbut a glute ham raise—not only a GHR but the best you can get: a\nprofessional GHR from Elite Fitness Systems. For the rest of the session\nthey were all doing wide stance GHR’s, close stance GHR’s, ab\nwork and anything else they could think of. \nIt was business as usual for Jonathan though. He was to stick with this\nplan until he got the nod of approval from the rest of the guys. He watched\nvideos and worked on his form any time he could find the time. He even\nfilmed his sessions to compare against the form of the guys on the tapes.\n\nAfter his form work he was told to train right along with some of the\nothers guys and get used to the many supplemental and accessory movements\nthey were using. He was now beginning to feel his body getting stronger\nand noticed that he’d already gained 15 pounds. Finally, he was becoming\na powerlifter, but he knew he had a long road ahead of him. \n\n“The Education of a Powerlifter” will continue next\nweek. \nFor more info and products from Dave Tate, visit Elite\nFitness Systems at www.eliteFTS.com."
