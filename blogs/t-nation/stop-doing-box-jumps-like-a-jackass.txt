"Here’s what you need to know…\n\nBox jumps potentiate the nervous system for gains in strength and size, assuming you do them correctly.\nIf you’re not getting full hip extension, you’re wasting your time.\nThose young geeks you see doing 50-inch box jumps just have fantastic hip flexibility rather than great jumping ability and explosive power.\nQuality is more important than quantity. Maximize the hip extension and land with sound technique.\nPerform box jumps as a potentiating exercise before you lift, not as a conditioning tool.\n\nGet Faster, Get Stronger\nNo one cares how strong you are if the speed at which you produce force is best described as glacial. You need speed to bring your strength to new levels and the quickest way to get explosive is with the box jump.\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Box-Jump-2.jpg\" alt=\"Box Jump\" />\n \nJumps are an awesome display of power, athleticism, and relative strength with directly applicable qualities to nearly every sport. And yes, they’ll get you more jacked, too. The problem is, they’re often over-prescribed and performed with atrocious form.\nLet’s fix that. Let’s examine the muscle and strength building benefits of box jumps, along with how to do them properly, and how to program them into your workouts for rapid gains in explosive power.\nThe Benefits of Box Jumps\nMost of the impressive box jumps you see aren’t what they appear. That 14-year-old kid hitting a 50 inch-box jump is impressive, but it’s a product of a pretty good jump and fantastic hip mobility rather than pure explosive power.\nEven worse than some of these phony-baloney jumps, people set themselves up for bloody shins, dangerous wipeouts, and faulty landing mechanics due to inappropriate prescriptions of jumps.\n \n\n\nLike every exercise, box jumps are a tool that must be treated carefully, not randomly thrown into your programming and conditioning.\nLow Impact Landings\nBox jumps are the most common jump variation in exercise programs for good reason – they decrease joint stress and provide a low stress environment to express power and practice sound landing mechanics.\nWhen compared to the landing height from a vertical jump, the box jump has significantly less compressive stress. Likewise, when compared to the broad jump, the box jump has less shear stress and compressive stress at the knee.\n \n\n\nOverall, there’s much less joint stress so you can keep your knees healthy while still developing explosive power.\nAnd because box jumps have a low overall impact, they allow for a greater training frequency compared to other jumping variations.\nPotentiate The Nervous System for Strength and Size\nThe absence of speed and power movements in training is probably limiting the amount of weight you use on the bar. No, you won’t gain muscle doing high volume box jumps, but you will potentiate the nervous system to fire at a more efficient, faster rate.\nBy improving nervous system efficiency, you’ll improve strength, which increases work capacity at sub-maximal weights to build muscle.\nReinforce Your Mechanics\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Female-Box-Jump.jpg\" alt=\"Female Box Jump\" />\n \nHaphazard, random jumps thrown together allow for sloppy mechanics to take place. Strive for the following:\n\nFeet are flat at landing rather than exhibiting an anterior or posterior weight shift.\nKnees are neutral, rather than in valgus or varus (diving in or diving out).\nAbs are braced. Any rounding of the back and trunk shows a power leak that will cascade down the kinetic chain.\nEyes and chest are up. If your landing in any sport leaves you bent over and looking at the ground, you’ll get lit up.\nPause and momentarily hold position at the top of the jump to decrease injury risk.\nStep off onto a lower box if jumping over 20 inches. Jumping off the box backwards places tons of stress on the Achilles tendon and poses an unnecessary risk.\n\nWhat Not to Do with Box Jumps\nBox jumps are a great tool to increase performance, but any tool used haphazardly and without planning sabotages gains and becomes potentially dangerous.\nDon’t Do Box Jumps for Conditioning\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Group-Box-Jumps.jpg\" alt=\"Group Box Jumps\" />\n \nEvery exercise requires a risk-reward analysis and box jumps fail miserably when used for conditioning.\nFor starters, jumps used as a conditioning implement often cause a breakdown of form in landing mechanics, which leads to battered shins and the engraining of poor mechanics like pronation of the feet and valgus collapse, both of which open the door for injury.\nIn addition, jumping for high reps and pushing the tempo minimizes full hip-extension, which ain’t good. Full hip-extension is the primary driver of a solid vertical jump and transfers to activities like sprinting, the lockout of a deadlift, or the end of your squat.\nHow you practice is how you play. If you use faulty mechanics in training, it’s going to show up when the lights come on. Keep box jumps where they belong, early in your workout as a power exercise and opt for low-impact jumping like the jump rope for conditioning.\nDon’t Use Box Jumps If You’re a Non-Athletic Desk Jockey\nMost “general fitness” folks rarely exercise and aren’t conditioned for high-force, high-impact exercises. Sedentary desk jobs, low-impact steady state cardio, and machine exercises are the norm for them.\nIf this is you, incorporating jumps without first engraining technique and conditioning the tissues for impact is a recipe for acute and chronic injuries.\nWork into box jumps with low impact movements like skipping rope to condition the legs for a week or two. Then, start at a low-box height and master landing mechanics before progressing to greater heights.\nProgramming Box Jumps\nThere’s a checklist of factors that must be taken into account with any exercise. First, if it hurts, don’t do it. If you can’t do it properly, regress to a shorter box. Likewise, if it doesn’t match your training goals, don’t do it.\nAssuming those precautions have been addressed, the low impact nature of box jumps makes them great for lifters. They’re a great tool to improve athleticism and power without the risk of higher impact jumps or the technicality of sprinting.\nBox jumps are an explosive exercise and should be programmed before lifting and after a warm-up. In order to increase your vertical and potentiate your body for better lifts, start with static box jumps for 2-3 sets of 3-5 reps.\nRemember, high volume isn’t important – high performance is. Two to four sets of 3-5 reps are fine for most people.\nA Sample Progression\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-Panel-Box-Jump.jpg\" alt=\"3 Panel Box Jump\" />\n \nPerform box jumps two times per week after a dynamic warm-up.\n\nWeek 1 – Jump Rope 5-10 min. (pre- or post-workout) 3x week\nWeek 2 – 2 x 5\nWeek 3 – 3 x 4\nWeek 4 – 4 x 4\nWeek 5 – (Increase Box Height) 3 x 5\nWeek 6 – 4 x 4\nWeek 7 – 4 x 3\nWeek 8 – (Increase Box Height) 3 x 3\n\nRemember, full hip extension on your jump and building sound landing mechanics is the most important thing, not height. Leave your ego at the door because there are no box-jump world championships.\nWithout full hip extension, you’ll limit the carryover to explosive lifts and athletic events, thus minimizing the training effect. You’ll also look like a doofus in the process."
