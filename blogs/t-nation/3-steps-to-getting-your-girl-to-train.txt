"Every guy wants a sexy, confident, in-shape woman on his arm. If you want to help your girlfriend or wife effectively change her body but don’t know where to start, then look no further.\nStep one is knowing what you’re up against. Virtually everything ever written in mainstream media about exercising “for women” sticks them in the cardio room with ankle weights, ready to pump-n-tone.\nThis can lead to considerable conflict for your lady, especially on day one when you usher her towards the scary squat rack and start adding weight. So since we’re dealing with women, let’s start with these “emotional” considerations.\n1 – Make a plan and be supportive\nGood support is a blend of the practical and emotional. At first it will be hard for your gal to commit to training and create the habit, so set her up for long term success by helping take care of the practical considerations.\nShe’ll need a plan to make it a reality time-wise, schedule-wise, and money-wise. Make your support as visceral as possible and reduce the number of “excuses” available.\nThe nice thing is, by doing this you’ll also be letting her know you care about her and her happiness and what taking care of her body will do for her. Both bases of support will be covered.\nDo\n\nSit down with her and find the time to work out. Schedule it in and keep that time sacred. Time is the biggest excuse – don’t let her use it.\nBuy her a gym membership, a new gym bag, or a gift certificate for some workout clothes. It’s part of the investment; investment enhances commitment.\nGo with her to the gym and lift together, or suggest ways to find a lifting partner. This is important especially in the beginning when she doesn’t know what she’s doing.\n\nDon’t\n\nTell her to start working out, but not help with a plan.\nLeave her to figure out form for the lifts and how to structure her workouts.\nGet impatient with what she doesn’t know. Teach her.\n\nThe aim is to make this a lifestyle change. The gym is already a part of your life – you have a gym bag, you dedicate time before or after work, and you reap the benefits.\nMake it a part of her life too. Having someone alongside supporting us makes us all warm and fuzzy inside, and makes you look like a big, bad knight in shining armor.\n2 – Give her some external motivation so she can build her internal motivation\nThere are two types of motivation to consider. Controlled or external motivation comes from external sources. This kind of motivation is best for jump-starting the process.\nOn the other hand, autonomous or internal motivation comes from personal conviction, the “I do it for me” kind of motivation. That’s the kind we’re aiming for in the long run, but it takes time to develop.\nThe best way is to add the intrinsic stuff as she progresses, to give her something to work for by using “reward” strategies.\nRewards don’t necessarily mean something you buy her; it can be reminders of accomplishment, the promise of hotter sex, telling her how incredible she is going to look, or how jealous her girlfriends will be.\nNot everyone can be motivated in exactly the same ways, but we’re not all that different.\nSo what exactly motivates a woman?\n\nYou thinking she’s hot and desirable.\nAvoiding the shame (no matter how unspoken) of an obviously unhealthy and unattractive body.\nThe empowerment that comes from looking and feeling good. Everything seems easier and more possible when you think you look good.\nEgo-involvements. If she sees other women like her that can do it and look awesome, why not her?\n“Do it for me.” Reminders of how much you love her attitude when she looks and feels good, how hot her body can be, and a bit of a “do it for me” strategy can work wonders.\n\nJust the act of exercise (not even a certain amount) has an impact on body-image confidence, and the link between the two is well established by research. With increased confidence comes a whole boatload of other good “side-effects.” But to get those benefits, she has to start.\nDo\n\nRemind her that accomplishing a workout feels great. Praise her for getting through the workouts, and doing what she set out to do.\nHelp her set numerical goals like squatting her own body weight, or doing a pull-up.\nBe a partner. She’s not in it alone, you’re in it together.\n\nDon’t\n\nCompare her to someone else. Stay away from comparisons, even “positive” ones.\nConstantly comment on other girls’ bodies, even if you’re doing it with good “motivational” intentions.\nTalk about how she used to look. Keep the focus on where she’s going and what she’s doing now.\n\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/deadlift-7.jpg\" alt=\"deadlift\" />\n\n3 – Emphasize Weight Training\nThis will have huge overall benefits, especially if she’s skinny fat. Getting women to weight train properly while ignoring all the misinformation is a big step. So, she’s got the time scheduled and you’ve convinced her not to be scared of the weights, what’s next?\nDo\n\nMake sure your gym has the right weight equipment or invest in home equipment. Women don’t need anything “special.” Barbells and dumbbells are where it’s at.\nTeach her proper form for the squat, deadlift, and bench/press. Show her how to do the assistance lifts.\nGive her a program to follow, like the ones outlined below. Explain why weight training will benefit her. Sculpting her body (what she thinks of as “toning”) with weights will do more for her than hours of cardio.\n\nDepending on how well you can satisfy her concerns, compel her to do a bit of research. Women who weight train, put some thought into diet, and are consistent, have the best body composition. Many women are shocked to hear this.\nRemember, the average female thinks that hour-long boot camps, treadmill sessions, and machine circuits with high reps are the way to go.\nDon’t\n\nLeave her stranded near the dumbbells with vague instructions. Not knowing how to do something and the fear of looking like a beginner will dampen her enthusiasm to start, or even kill it completely.\nConfuse her with too many ideas about advanced training techniques. She needs to get the basics down: big compound moves, progressive overload, and consistency.\nShow her pics of super hot “normal” girls who look good, train hard, and have a life.\n\nAll women can start with the basic lifts (or easier variations of them), and work and learn from there. What’s important in the beginning is spending enough time under tension to recruit more muscle fibers, and practicing the lifts to get the motor patterns down.\nSticking with big, compound movements and throwing in assistance work along with some HIIT circuits or sprints will yield the best results. Build her strength base to get her neuromuscular system going and stimulate growth before you fiddle with complicated programming or start getting into “cycles” and “splits.”\nBefore we get to the programs, give her some basic knowledge. This may sound like info most anyone would know, but many women will be complete newbies to the rules and norms of the weight room. Teach her:\n\nHow much the different bars weigh, and how to track the weight (i.e., you include the weight of the bar in the total, what sets and reps are, etc.).\nHow to load and remove plates properly and easily. What the different bars are called (barbell, EZ curl bar, trap bar, etc.).\nBasic terminology, such as what incline, decline, supinated, and pronated mean.\nEmphasize strength goals as a way to determine progress, not soreness and how much she sweated; a common trap that can kill gains.\n\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/female-squat.jpg\" alt=\"female-squat\" />\n\nThe Programs\nBelow are three programs to try, depending on how many days a week she can train and her knowledge level.\nStick to slightly higher rep ranges in the beginning, even for the bigger compound movements. She won’t be lifting heavy enough to benefit from anything fewer than 5 reps anyway. The key here is practicing the movements and getting in enough reps to stimulate her neuromuscular system and induce growth.\nThe focus should be on strength first. Only after a strength base is built can training be manipulated to suit more specific personal goals. You can’t sculpt muscle if you don’t have any to work with.\nTo that end, focus on increasing strength through progressive overload to develop a base that will benefit whatever type of training style she ends up liking best, and any body parts she wants to focus on changing even more later on.\nFinishing off with some short metabolic style workouts 1-2 times a week like Tabata, HITT, or intervals will get her sweating a bit and make her feel like she “worked more” (one of the reasons women love spin classes and cardio boot camps).\n2 or 3 Days a Week – Super Basic Whole Body\n\n5 sets of 5-8 reps with as challenging a weight as possible. Start with 8 reps.\nReps can be higher if she needs more time to get the movement down.\nKeep rest to 1-2 minutes.\n\nWorkout 1\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nSquat to a box\n5\n5-8\n1-2 min.\n\n\nB\nBench Press\n5\n5-8\n1-2 min.\n\n\nC\nPush-Up\n5\n5-8\n1-2 min.\n\n\nD\nPlank\n5\n \n1-2 min.\n\n\nWorkout 2\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nTrap Bar Deadlift\n5\n5-8\n1-2 min.\n\n\nB\nRack Pull\n5\n5-8\n1-2 min.\n\n\nC\nChin or Inverted Row\n5\n5-8\n1-2 min.\n\n\nD\nLeg Raise\n5\n \n1-2 min.\n\n\nWorkout 3\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nGoblet Squat\n5\n5-8\n1-2 min.\n\n\nB\nRear Lunge\n5\n5-8\n1-2 min.\n\n\nC\nOverhead Dumbbell/Barbell Press\n5\n5-8\n1-2 min.\n\n\nD\nSide Plank\n5\n30-90 sec.\n1-2 min.\n\n\nProgram Mon/Wed/Fri – Starting Strength Style\n\n5 sets of 5-8 reps using the same weight across the working sets (3 warm-up sets, 5 working sets), except for deadlifts where you progressively add weight, so only the last set is the heaviest.\nIf she can’t do pull-ups, start with inverted rows and/or assisted chin-ups with a resistance band.\n\nMonday\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nSquat\n5\n5-8\n\n\nB\nBench Press or Press (Alternating)\n5\n5-8\n\n\nC\nChin-Up\n3\nto failure\n\n\nD\nPush-Up\n5\n5-8\n\n\nWednesday\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nSquat\n5\n5-8\n\n\nB\nPress or Bench Press (Alternating)\n5\n5-8\n\n\nC\nDeadlift\n5\n5-8\n\n\nD\nReverse Lunge\n5\n5-8\n\n\nFriday\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nSquat\n5\n5-8\n\n\nB\nBench Press or Press (Alternating)\n5\n5-8\n\n\nC\nPull-Up\n3\nto failure\n\n\nD\nGlute-Ham Raise\n5\n5-8\n\n\nProgram Upper/Lower Split – PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training) Style\n\nFor power days, 3-5 sets of 5-8 reps.

Give it enough time to work.\nStart at the higher end of the reps/sets, gradually moving to the lower end as her strength increases and the weight becomes heavy enough for her to benefit from lower reps. Get in enough time under tension. Eight reps is a good starting place for the big lifts.\nKeep her away from cardio, especially on lifting days. If she has to be “weaned” off of excessive cardio, let her finish every workout with a short, intense circuit and ab work.\nThis intense circuit can include treadmill sprints, stair sprints, 100 kettlebell swings for time, tire flips for reps, sled pulls for time, bodyweight circuits for reps.\nSomething short, hard, and fast will facilitate weight loss, muscle gain, and give her the “high” of hard work without impeding progress too much. Or let her do low-intensity steady state type cardio on rest days. Just keep the intensity low and under an hour. Walks are great.\nGet her a notebook or an app to track her workouts. This is very important for goal setting.\nDon’t increase the weight every workout until she has proper form down. Instead, increase the weight every week. If she’s having a hard time getting form down, keep the weight light, bump up the reps to 10-12, and let her practice.\nConnect her with resources to learn more and continue her journey. Do not send her to women’s magazines to learn how to train.\nConnecting her with solid information will be important for building that internal motivation discussed earlier. Get her reading, connecting, and following the same trainers, coaches, and authors as you.\nThere’s a wealth of good information out there that she can benefit from just like you do. Encourage her to become part of the “culture.” Women who lift well are still in the minority, but we’re out there!\n\nWrap Up\nAs her interest and progress grows, she’ll no longer need as much support from you to get her workout in. She’ll have her own reasons to keep at it and the passion will be sparked.\nA great body is hers to get – and yours to enjoy!"
