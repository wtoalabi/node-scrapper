"I know what you’re all thinking: another article about complexes that I’ll never use cause I want to be big and strong, not just smash myself.\nI feel your pain. Complexes have been covered extensively in the fitness and bodybuilding media, including T Nation. That said, this ain’t your momma’s complex training article – what you’re about to read may be the Greatest Complex Article of All Time (yeah, I said that).\nSo How’s This different?\nThe complexes in this article will help you burn fat, get strong as an ox, and put your will to the test. Granted, there are many complexes already published that can accomplish this, but these are different.\nThey use different rules, different implements, and way different rep schemes than what you’re used to. And the results they deliver give new meaning to the expression “change is good.”\nNew Rules for the Complex\n \n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/trx-military-1.jpg\" alt=\"trx-military\" />\n\n1 – Pick an implement.\nBarbell complexes are the most popular and are what I choose to do most of my complexes with (Im an Olympic lifter, so it makes sense).\nHowever, any implement will do. Kettlebells, sandbags, dumbbells, or a TRX can all be the tools of your destruction. Each implement has its advantages and disadvantages, so use them accordingly.\nFor instance, barbells suck when it comes to upper body pulling exercises, and the TRX sucks for vertical pressing exercises. Pick something and rock it out the best you can.\n2 – Choose from several categories (or just a couple).\nWith barbells I like to choose from tons of categories. Pretty much every complex has an explosive movement, some sort of hinging and squatting pattern, and likely some pressing or pulling.\nWhen it comes to the other tools, you can still do the same thing and stay balanced, but an alternative is to smoke a particular movement pattern or a body part.\n\nUse the kettlebell to just work on your conditioning by doing a ton of swings, snatches, and carries.\nUsing the TRX or suspension trainer, pick multiple movements that require a ton of stability, and targeted ab exercises to hammer your core.\n\nIf you choose from multiple categories you can get an awesome finisher; if you choose from just a couple you can dominate some body part training.\nThe list below offers some ideas for movements from each category.\n\n\nCategories\nSandbag\nKettlebell\nDumbbell\nTRX\n\n\nExplosive\nRotational Snatch,\nSplit Clean,\nShouldering\nSwing,\nSnatch,\nClean,\nDeadlift Jumps\nSplit Jumps,\nSnatches,\nCleans,\nSquat Jumps,\nSplit Jerk\nJump Squats,\nSprinter Starts,\nPistol Jumps\n\n\nLower Body Push\nBear Hug Squat,\nShouldered Squat,\nOverhead Squat,\nRotational Lunge\nGoblet Squat,\nThreaded Lunge,\nReverse Lunge w/ Rotation,\nDbl Front Squat\nGoblet Squat,\nLunge,\nReverse Lunge\nRFE Split Squat,\nAssisted Pistols\n\n\nLower Body Pull\nZercher Good Morning,\nSingle-Leg RDL\nRDL,\nSingle-Leg RDL,\nDeadlift\nSingle-Leg RDL,\nRDL,\nStiff-Leg King Deadlift\nSHELC (Supine Hip Extension to Leg Curl) Supine Sprinters\n\n\nUpper Body Push\nShoulder to Shoulder Press,\nPush Press\nRacked Press,\nPush Press,\nFloor Press\nPress,\nPush Press\nPush-Up Variations (Hands In or Out),\nTriceps Extensions,\nHandstand Push-Ups\n\n\nUpper Body Pull\nBent Over Row (Again)\nBent Over Row,\nDouble Sumo DL High Pull,\nRenegade Row\nRenegade Row,\nBent-Over Row\nMuscle-Up,\nInverted Row,\nFacepull,\nYTI Rows,\nCurls\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nCrawl and Drags,\nShouldered Get-Ups,\nCyclones\nTurkish Get-Up,\nChops and Lifts,\nCarries\n \nSawing,\nPikes,\nKnee Tucks,\nCore Worm\n\n\n3 – Use rep schemes that make it interesting.\nWe always see the same thing, “Do x reps for x sets.” It’s time to ditch that line of thinking!\nTry some innovative ways to use complexes in terms of sets and reps. Here are some that I use:\nAscending/Descending Pyramids (1,2,3,…3,2,1)\nStart with 1 rep of each exercise and move through. Each set add a rep until you can add no more. Then, descend the pyramid back until you finish with 1 rep again. When it gets hard, tell yourself that after you finish the hardest set (the top of the pyramid), it’ll only get easier.\nAccommodating Complexes (AC)\nYou know yourself better than any coach, so why not figure out yourself how many reps you can do on each exercise?\nFor instance, say you can do 10 kettlebell swings, but only 3 snatches per arm, 8 goblet squats, and 15 Romanian deadlifts? Voila! You now have the perfect rep scheme for your kick-ass kettlebell complex.\nComplex Drop Sets (DS)\nPick your exercises, sets, and reps; say 3 sets of 6 reps on every exercise.Now choose a challenging weight and get to work on your 3 sets.\nAt the end of 3 sets drop the movement that’s most challenging, or the one where you were closest to technical failure. For each set after that, move up in weight to challenge yourself and approximate the volume from the first 3 sets.\nThe Sandbag Complex\nI’m a big fan of the sandbag. Adding in a rotational component to exercises makes it an awesome tool for athletes needing greater stability in all planes of motion.\n\n\n\nIn the video my athlete is using an 80-pound bag and he’s getting crushed by the end.\nThe cool thing about the sandbag is that it offers so many different options for holding it. While the barbell offers very little in the way of changing grips, with the sandbag we can shoulder it, hug it, crossbody hug it, and Zercher hold it. The possibilities are many, and each different grip or hold offers a different set of challenges.\nHere’s an example:\n\n\n \nExercise\nReps\n\n\nA\nSplit Clean\n5/side\n\n\nB\nRotational Lunge\n4/side\n\n\nC\nPush Press\n8\n\n\nD\nZercher Good Morning\n8\n\n\nE\nShouldered Get-Up\n2/side\n\n\nThe Kettlebell Complex\n\n\n\nEverything is rosy when you have 2 hands firmly on a barbell, but it can be a different story when you’re forced to move unilaterally. The beautiful thing about many kettlebell movements is that they’re designed to be completed one hand at a time.\nThis complex forces you to brace for rotation, and can absolutely smoke your core. I use this with drop sets by working up to 3 sets of 5 reps and then dropping the hardest exercise, in this case, the Single Leg Romanian Deadlift Plus Row.\nOnce that beast is out, I move up in weight with my ‘bells while thanking the Almighty for taking mercy on me, and move on.\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nOne-Arm Swing\n3\n5 each *\n\n\nB\nThreaded Lunge\n3\n5 each *\n\n\nC\nSLRDL + Row\n3\n5 each *\n\n\nD\nStrict Press\n3\n5 each *\n\n\n* drop sets\nThe 2 Kettlebell Complex\n\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite complexes for developing strength. There aren’t many things harder than working with two heavy-ass kettlebells.\nIn no scientific way whatsoever, I’ve determined that a double-kettlebell front squat is just as difficult as a barbell front squat with twice the weight. Seriously though, even the strongest athletes wilt under two racked kettlebells.\nIn this video my athlete is on his 3-rep set as he descends the backside of the 1-5 pyramid illustrated below. Needless to say, he’s smoked.\n\n\n \nExercise\nReps\n\n\nA\nDouble Clean\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n\n\nB\nFront Squat\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n\n\nC\nPush Press\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n\n\nD\nSumo Deadlift High Pull\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n\n\nAnd Now, Introducing Monkey Jumps\nThis complex features a move that I named monkey jumps a long time ago, before I had ever seen a real monkey in nature or a zoo, and it turns out monkeys don’t actually do this.\nThe name stays, though.\n\n\n\nMonkey jumps are just the C exercises of this complex, and combine an alternating split jump with a high pull on each jump. They may look funny, but the truth is they actually have some carryover to the Olympic lifts as it mimics the timing of pulling yourself down to the bar.\n\n\n \nExercise\nReps\n\n\nA\nSnatch\n5\n\n\nB\nSplit Jerk\n5\n\n\nC\nMonkey Jumps\n5\n\n\nD\nRenegade Rows\n5\n\n\nTRX Complex\n\n\n\nIf you ever get the urge to do a complex on a beach or in a forest (which I’m embarrassed to say has happened to me on more than one occasion), and don’t have access to your kettlebells and dumbbells, you’re basically out of luck. However, if you happened to have a suspension trainer with you, you’re ready to rock it out no matter where you find yourself.\nThis is a killer complex if you use it in an ascending fashion. In the video below I filmed my set of 5 reps as I worked up to 8 reps of each exercise.\n\n\n \nExercise\nReps\n\n\nA\nSHELC\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\n\nB\nPush-Ups\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\n\nC\nCore Worm\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\n\nD\nHandstand Push-Ups\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\n\nThe Obligatory Barbell Complex\nYou didn’t think that I’d leave this one out did you? Like Vin Diesel in The Fast and Furious series, you knew the barbell had to make an appearance, even if only for a moment at the end.\nFor this cameo I’m going way back in the archives to bring out the Javorek complex, appropriately named after its creator, Istvan (Steve) Javorek.\nSo how is the oldest complex in the book any different from the hundreds of complexes you have seen before?\nBig ass weights.\n\n\n\nJavorek writes of the need to do this complex at extremely high weights as a predictor of future performance. He tells tales of this complex being completed with 240 pounds by Romanian weightlifters, and 220-pound exploits by American record holders.\nI personally witnessed my former Olympian coach complete this complex with over 200 pounds. After picking my jaw up from the floor and searching for my manhood, I completed this complex with 165 pounds. I went on to clean 330 pounds later that training cycle.\nBut in case you’re not going to the Olympics, there’s a very simple rule to follow to make sure this complex will challenge your strength and will: use 50% of your 1RM clean and jerk.\nThe 50% rule is what the best athletes are able to do with this 30-rep complex and it provides an indicator of what you’re capable of (with good technique) on the platform.\nIn the video below of the Javorek complex, I’m using 143 pounds (which is about 50% of my current 300-pound clean and jerk 1RM).\n\n\n \nExercise\nReps\n\n\nA\nBarbell Upright Row\n6\n\n\nB\nBarbell Muscle Snatch\n6\n\n\nC\nBack Squat to Push Press\n6\n\n\nD\nGood Morning\n6\n\n\nE\nBent Over Row\n6\n\n\nConclusion\nComplexes are a fantastic, multifaceted tool, and using a variety of tools and many different rep schemes makes them even better.\nWhen you’re stumped for a training session, crave some variety, or just want to punish yourself, there’s likely a complex for you. If you manage to get through all of these complexes, I’m certain that your next challenge will be how to design a complex of sleeping, eating, and napping."
