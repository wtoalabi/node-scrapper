"Here’s what you need to know…\n•\nBreathing paused squats could be the hardest, most effective tool in your the toolkit.\n•\nBy exhaling under a squat, you remove intra-abdominal pressure, meaning the job of stabilizing the pelvis and spine shifts to the musculature.\n•\nMost who try them experience a 20-30 pound squat PR and a half-inch of leg growth in one month.\nWhile regular paused squats are definitely tough and effective, breathing while\nunder the weight substantially magnifies both the difficulty and the benefit.\nThe Three Demands\nYour knees are flexed at the bottom of a squat, your hips are flexed, and your\ntorso is inclined forward with the bar resting on your shoulders. You need to do\nthree things to drive the bar up – extend your knees, extend your hips, and maintain\ntorso rigidity to transfer force into the bar.\nThe first two demands receive a lot of attention but the third demand, maintaining\ntorso rigidity, is often overlooked or trained inefficiently. But without it, all\nthat force produced by your legs and hips will never transfer to the bar.\nSpecificity\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/01-6.jpg\" alt=\"Specificity\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" />\nIn the strength game, specificity is key. Training your body to complete a task in\na specific way tends to be the best way to achieve the desired adaptation. So for\ntraining any aspect of the squat, you can’t beat the effects of having a heavy bar on\nyour back and squatting.\nThe question then becomes, how can you tweak the squat to magnify its effects of\ngiving you an ironclad torso? Answer: you breathe. Here’s why:\nTwo main things stabilize your pelvis and spine at the bottom of a squat –\nintra-abdominal pressure, and the musculature supporting your pelvis and spine.\nIt’s easy to maximize intra-abdominal pressure. Just learn the Valsalva maneuver\n(where you exhale forcefully against a closed airway) and put on a belt. But we’ll\nfocus more on the musculature supporting the pelvis and spine because it can be\nimproved through training.\nBy exhaling under a squat, you purposefully remove intra-abdominal\npressure, meaning the job of stabilizing the pelvis and spine shifts entirely to the\nmusculature that directly supports it.\nYour abs, transverse abdominis, and obliques have to work doubly hard without the\naid of a full belly of air. When this supporting musculature becomes stronger,\nsquatting normally becomes significantly easier as a stronger core means more\nefficient force transfer from your legs to the bar.\nAs a bonus, the long pause at the bottom gives your legs extra time under tension,\nproviding a great hypertrophy stimulus for your wheels. You know how beltless squats\nare much harder than belted squats? It’s because pushing your stomach out against the\nbelt increases intra-abdominal pressure.\nOn the other hand, when going beltless, even though your legs are just as strong,\nyou can’t move as much weight because you can’t brace your pelvis and spine as well.\nThink of breathing paused squats as a magnification of the same concept.\nHow To Do It\nLet me describe this in easier terms. You’re going to squat just like normal, but\non your last rep, you’re going to stay in the down position and take a pre-determined\nnumber of deep, full, breaths, thereby removing intra abdominal pressure and making\nyour core work all that much harder.\nWith added core strength comes greater stability. With greater stability comes new PRs.\nTo implement breathing paused squats, start by just using them on the last rep of\neach warm-up set. So if you typically start off your squat workouts with 135 for 10\nreps, then just add 5-10 full breaths (full exhale, full inhale into the stomach) at\nthe bottom of the tenth rep.\nIf your next warm-up is 185 for 5 reps, add 3-5 breaths at the bottom of the fifth rep, and so on.\nObviously you’ll want to keep it light the first few times you try it, but\nexperiment with adding breaths on increasingly heavy sets as you get more\ncomfortable, being mindful to never go past your comfort zone. Make it a 4-5 month\ngoal of being able to exhale under about 80% of your 1RM squat.\nAlways inhale again before you come up, though. You’ll find that as the weight\nunder which you can breathe increases, maximal weights will feel increasingly lighter on your back.\nThe Results\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/02-5.jpg\" alt=\"The Results\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" />\nResults will vary of course, but most who implement this tip experience a 20-30\npound squat PR and a half-inch of leg growth in a month – without any other\nprogramming modifications.\nIn my case, I put nearly 100 pounds on my squat in about 4 months. I focused on\nbreathing paused squats (bringing my breathing paused squat PR from 315 to 585\npounds) and increasing hip torque (through sumo rack pulls) to take advantage of the\nincreased ability to maintain rigidity.\nAnd while my other lower body accessory lifts remained stagnant, my 1RM squat\nclimbed from a shaky 655 pounds in the gym with questionable depth, to a deep 750 in a meet.\nWondering if you could benefit the same way I did? Let’s do a little rough math\nand a simple test. Assuming a 45-degree incline, you can squat about 70% of the\nweight you load on the leg press.\nThat means every Joe Shmoe who can leg press 700 – a common feat in most gyms –\nproduces enough force from his legs and hips to squat 495 pounds, a very rare feat in most gyms.\nThe key difference is that you directly transmit force to the platform of the leg\npress, but force transfer to the bar when squatting is dependent on how rigid you can\nkeep your torso. If there’s a large disparity between your squat and 70% of your leg\npress, then breathing paused squats are sure to remedy this deficit and put size on\nyour legs and some serious pounds on your max in a hurry.\nAll On You\nAre they hard? Absolutely. Unorthodox? Sure. But they’re undeniably effective, and\nthere’s no way to train your torso for the squat with greater specificity than with\nbreathing paused squats."
