"In my first Random Thoughts article, I mentioned how my approach to nutrition and strength and\nconditioning was much like that of George Carlin when it came to\ncomedy: I really had no transitional material.\nIn honor of this great comedian’s passing in mid-June, it seemed\nonly fitting to toss out an equally random sequel.\nAnd Off We Go…\n1. When spotting, don’t ever shout out, “It’s all you.” In fact,\ndon’t say it at all at any time in your life. Those in the know\nrealize that when this phrase is used, it was never, in fact, “all\nthem.” Rather, this is what frat boys who bench three times a week\nsay to justify their existence.\nFrom now on, when you feel the urge to say, “It’s all you,” just\nsubstitute the phrase, “I’m weak and have never kissed a girl.”\nThe shock value will be the same, but the rest of us won’t have\nto do any extra mental work to interpret the real meaning of your\nstatement.\n2. If your elbow hurts, look first at shoulder dysfunction and\nsoft tissue restrictions in the forearms and triceps. Or, just stop\nleaning on your elbow so much; your ulnar nerve hates\nyou.\n3. Without him knowing it, I recently convinced one of our high\nschool athletes to do the YMCA dance as a shoulder health series.\nAt the time, it was just us goofing around – and the video\nwas really amusing (I promised him I wouldn’t share it).\nIn hindsight, though, I was probably on to something:\nY: Lower trap activation, thoracic extension\nM: Pec minor length, thoracic extension\nC: Internal rotation range of motion\nA: Lat length, thoracic extension\nI haven’t really taken the time to break down the Macarena or\nFunky Chicken yet, but I think it’s safe to say that the Electric\nSlide will get your glute medius firing a bit.\n4. It’s all you!\nOkay, maybe not. See how stupid that sounded?\n5. Eccentric stress in sports is what causes the most marked\nlosses in range of motion, particularly in high-velocity sports.\nFor instance, with baseball pitchers, the goal in-season is to\nminimize the loss of internal rotation at the shoulder, extension\nat the elbow, and internal rotation and flexion at the hip.\nWhy? These are the exact movements the pitcher is attempting to\ndecelerate (eccentric muscle action) with each pitch.\nEffectively, keeping guys healthy is largely a function of\n“length and strength” of these decelerating muscles.\n6. A high school female athlete recently walked in with a\ntraining program she got from a national camp. While I could’ve\npoked a ton of holes in the program, the thing that stuck out to me\nthe most was the fact that it included three sets of ten on\ninverted rows.\nYou see, I can count on one hand the number of female high\nschool athletes I’ve ever seen who can do one inverted row\nin good form. So, the logical progression is to recommend ten for\nall of the female athletes in this age group. Riiiiight.\n7. Okay, I can’t resist; that program also included the\nfollowing progression for side bridges:\nWeek 1: 60 seconds per side\nWeek 2: 75 seconds per side\nWeek 3: 90 seconds per side\nWeek 4: 105 seconds per side\nIt was then that I realized that I’d been wrong all along in\ntraining this athlete for her chosen sport. Apparently, this coach\nhad seen something I hadn’t, and she was clearly better suited for\nfame and fortune as a professional side-bridger.\nSeriously, folks, if you can do a side bridge for one minute and\n45 seconds, you don’t need to be doing side bridges anymore –\nor you at least ought to find some way to make them harder. Try a\none-leg side bridge, at the very least.\n8. Last month, I attended Cassandra Forsythe-Pribanic’s wedding.\nAlso in attendance was Lou Schuler, who (along with Alwyn Cosgrove)\nco-authored The New Rules of Lifting for Women with Cass.\nLou and I got to talking about career stuff while we were\nwaiting in line, and he offered some of the best professional\nadvice that I’d ever received. While you’re probably thinking that\nI’m going to tell you what he told me, that’s not the case. Rather,\nI just wanted to remind you that surrounding yourself with\nbarbequed dead animal flesh always brings out the best in a\nman.\n9. This stretch for the hip external rotators looked awesome\nwhen I first saw it:\nThen, I tried it out, and it felt like someone had put my junk\nin a trash compactor. Some things just look so much better on\npaper, so I went with the bilateral version instead.\n10. The stretch above is great for powerlifters, hockey and\nsoccer players, and anyone else who tends to walk with their feet\n“turned out.” For a lot of guys, it’s an ankle mobility\nissue, but in many cases, it’s just a function of the hip being\nstuck in external rotation and the entire lower leg going along for\nthe ride.\nI also use it a lot with pitchers, as external rotator\ncontracture causes guys to open up too early on their lead leg,\nwhich can throw shoulders, elbows, and lower backs under the\nbus.\n11. Recently, I wrote medicine ball push-ups into a program for\nan online consulting client. He replied to me that they didn’t have\na single medicine ball in their gym (but he did jokingly observe\nthat they had dozens of BOSU and stability balls).\nThis not only reiterated the fact that most gyms are designed by\npeople who have no clue, but also made me realize how spoiled I am\nto have over a dozen medicine balls and an 18-foot concrete wall in\nour facility.\nI don’t care why you train; this stuff is fun and has great\ncarryover to the real world.\n12. Your balls still suck. Ha!\n13. When I was in Ireland earlier this year, an 18-year-old guy\ncome up to me and asked if I minded showing him the proper\ntechnique for a cable crossover. I just asked him how much he\nbenched, and he replied with “85kg” (187 pounds and he weighed\nabout 200).\nDoing cable crossovers at that point is roughly the equivalent\nof preparing for the SAT with a coloring book.\n14. One quick way to tell if an athlete is locking their\nshoulder blades down and back enough while benching is to put a\npiece of tape across the bench in line with the top of their head.\nIf they slide up, you’ll see that they aren’t locked in enough;\nthis is particularly noticeable on sets with multiple reps.\nIn the video below, you’ll see that not locking the shoulder\nblades in place doesn’t just change head position, but it also\nallows the scapulae to tilt anteriorly (forward) at the bottom of\neach rep. Over time, this can beat up the anterior capsule of the\nshoulder.\nGetting the lower traps strong and working on length and tissue\nquality of the pec minor can make it easier to fix this technique\nflaw.\n15. A 16-year-old hockey player I just started training told me\nthat he had previously gone to a personal trainer who gave him an\narm day. After some consideration, I’ve come to the conclusion that\nthis fleecing of his parents’ money was ethically on par with\nviolating him with a rusty coat hanger.\n16. My all-time favorite personality is the “Always Changing\nPrograms Guy” (also known as “ACPG” or the “Acronym Guy”).\nWhen observed in his natural habitat, he may be doing OVT one\nsecond, and then move on to NNM, ABBH, GVT2000, or HST-100 at a\nmoment’s notice. This guy needs less ADD, and a nice WCSTHU (warm\ncup of shut the hell up).\nYou have one ass, dude; pick a saddle.\n17. Would you believe that in 2002, there was $283 million in\nsalary wasted on players on the disabled list in major league\nbaseball – a total of over 24,000 days of lost “work” (which\nequates to roughly 65 days per player).\nYou know what else? That’s a lot of worker’s compensation being\npaid. And you can bet that the numbers are even higher now with\nincreasing salaries and inflation.\n18. Some people disagree with the “new age” concept of training\nthe lower back for stability and not mobility, saying that sit-ups,\ncrunches, sidebends, and lumbar rotation training is\nacceptable.\nHere’s a different perspective for them:\nIf you crack your radius and ulna at the middle of your forearm,\nthey put you in a cast to lock those bones in position so that they\ncan heal properly. Nobody ever argues with that approach. Think\nabout what it is, though. In fracturing those bones, you’ve taken a\nsegment of the body that was designed for stability and made it\nmobile. So, the solution to heal the problem is to lock up the area\ntemporarily to condition it for long-term effective force\ntransfer.\nYou know what happens when a young athlete gets spondylolysis\n(vertebral fracture) at the lumbar spine? They put them in a brace\nlike this:\nIn other words, they lock up a hypermobile segment of the body\nto return it to a physiological “norm” – and the healing\nrates are very good. It makes a lot of sense, as most of these\ninjuries occur in athletes with poor hip and thoracic mobility who\nmust go to the lumbar spine to get the range of motion they lack.\nMaybe if more people did their “core training” as if they were in a\nback brace like this, we’d see fewer lower back injuries.\n19. 99% of the young athletes who walk in to Cressey Performance\nfor the first time don’t know how to do a correct push-up. If you\nhave a son or daughter and want to do them a great justice, teach\ngood push-up form early on.\nKey points: chin tucked, eyes look directly down at the floor,\nupper arms at a 45-degree angle to the torso, hips up (not\nsagging), and the chest reaches the floor first.\n20. Along those same lines, the best coaches are needed with the\nyoungest athletes, as they’re the most impressionable in terms of\nmotor and psychological development. A bad coach at the college or\nprofessional level simply gets fired, and the athletes move on. A\nbad coach in the grade-school and adolescent years can make a kid\ndislike exercise for life and set him up for a host of chronic and\ntraumatic injuries thanks to poor technique and overuse.\n21. Contrary to what Tony Gentilcore may try to tell you, nobody\nhas ever gotten strong listening to techno while they train. Quit\npopping your collars and let it go, people.\n22. In those who are more flexion intolerant (e.g., disc\nherniation patients), once they’ve been cleared for return to\nexercise, it’s a good idea to start them with some exercises that\nencourage extension – and getting the arms up does exactly\nthat.\nI really like overhead dumbbell reverse lunges:\nYou can also do dumbbell overhead step-ups and walking lunges\n(with one or two arms held overhead). Shoulder strength and\nendurance are often the limiting factor, so automatically people\ncan’t be stupid and add too much compressive loading right off the\nbat.\nEventually, you progress to reverse lunges with a front squat\ngrip:\nImportant note: This load would not be appropriate for\nsomeone right after they get cleared for exercise! This is a guy\nwith a 430-pound front squat and 40-inch vertical jump, as a frame\nof reference.\nThe End of the Ride\nAnd in an appropriately random fashion, I’ll end on #22. Rest\nassured, though, there’ll be more to come."
