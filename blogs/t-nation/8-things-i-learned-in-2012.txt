"I wrote my first “What I Learned in” feature for T\nNation back in 2006 – over 7 years ago! – and a lot has happened since then.\nI’m no longer the young whippersnapper picking fights on the\nT Nation forum. I’ve morphed into an old man with a receding hairline that\nprefers to yell at the television and complain about the damn kids who walk on my\nlawn, rather than argue with folks on the internet.\nKidding aside (excluding my hairline; sadly, that part wasn’t\na joke), a lot has changed in the world of health, human performance, and getting huge.\nNew research is introduced constantly, and smart people take\nthis research and apply it with existing theories to make their training and\nnutrition programs just a little more awesome with each passing day.\nIn such a dynamic industry, if you’re not staying up-to-date\non new research and always testing new ideas out, you’ll quickly fall behind.\nTo that end, my “What I Learned in” series has\nbecome a great opportunity for me to recap my biggest discoveries of the year.\nMy hope is that they’ll be as beneficial to you as they’ve been to me.\nHere’s my top 8.\n1. Strength is actually very easy to maintain – and even improve – if you’re consistent.\nI retired my powerlifting singlet back in 2007. I still\nloved to train and always enjoyed the camaraderie I saw in the powerlifting\nworld, but I simply didn’t have the time to devote to it that I had in my early 20’s.\nWith a wife, business, and host of other responsibilities,\ntraining became more of something I did for fun than something I did for\ncompetition – and I was fine with that.\nJust for shits and giggles, though, I decided to run my own “mock”\npowerlifting meet this past fall just to see where things stood. I weighed in\nat 180 first thing in the morning, and then went out and totaled 1435 pounds,\nan Elite raw total in the 181-pound weight class. It took just under two hours.\n \n\n\nNote: I used a giant cambered bar for squatting just because\nI’ve got a shoulder that doesn’t love back squats.\nInterestingly, I never totaled Elite in powerlifting gear,\nwhich kind of makes me regret not lifting raw from the start! However, my\nbiggest takeaway from this experience was that I didn’t have to absolutely\ncrush every lift to make long-term progress.\nThere were a lot of training sessions along the way when I\nscaled things back because I was dragging, and my training volume wasn’t as\nhigh as it used to be. I probably trained more in the 80-90% of 1RM range more\nthan I did in the 90-100% range.\nI did, however, always show up. I never miss training sessions.\nIf you want to make insane improvements in strength, you\nneed to have an incredibly narrow focus – doing everything you can to support\ntraining at high percentages with sufficient volume.\nYou need to train frequently, deload at the right times, eat\nplenty of calories, and pay attention to a host of other factors.\nThe good news, however, is that it appears that if you want\nto simply keep the ball rolling in the right direction from a strength\nstandpoint, you just need to make sure you get your ass to the gym and put in some effort.\n2. The Glute Guy might’ve been a royal pain in the ass (pun intended), but he was right.\nBack in August of 2009, while in Long Beach to present at\nthe Perform Better 3-day Summit, I was in the lobby talking to one of the other\npresenters when I noticed someone a few feet away; he was apparently waiting to chat with us.\nIt was particularly amusing, because he was anxiously\nbobbing side to side like a little kid who was about to pee his pants, and he\nwas holding a few big fat envelopes.\nAfter my friend and I wrapped up our conversation, we turned\nour attention to the gentleman who was waiting for us. It was clear that he’d\nbeen preparing for this conversation for quite some time, as he had handouts\nprepared for both of us.\nMoreover, he launched into no less than a 60-minute diatribe\nabout glutes. Yes, butt cheeks. He talked functional anatomy, training\ntechniques, carryover to performance, and a host of other topics all related to\nglutes. In fact, he covered absolutely everything there was to cover short of\nasshole-wiping technique and how to cure hemorrhoids.\nIt was by far the most homoerotic training presentation I’ve\never witnessed. I’m just glad he didn’t try to go into any more “depth,”\nor else we likely would’ve been walking funny for the rest of the weekend.\nAfter what seemed like four hours, we did our best to\npolitely excuse ourselves from the conversation to head to lunch. As we walked\naway, my wife – who is somewhat desensitized to some of the crazy product and\nsupplement pitches I get on a regular basis – commented on how he was a top 5\nnut-job that we’d ever encountered at one of these events. The seminar ended\nthe next day, so we didn’t have any more interaction before we headed out. Bullet dodged.\nAs annoying and untimely as he might’ve been, though, the\nguy made some good points, so I pulled out his envelope and opened it up on the\nflight home. At the top of the first page, it read:\nAdvanced Techniques in Glutei Maximi Strengthening\nby Bret Contreras\nUnlike the meandering dissertation we’d experienced in the\nlobby in Long Beach, this was a lucid and strong case for us to reevaluate the\nway that we train the glutes. It was incredibly well researched and presented.\nBret might have been a lunatic, but he was extremely bright\nand ballsy enough to question the status quo and introduce exercises that might\nchange the way folks train.\nA month later, T Nation also recognized how forward-thinking\nBret was, as it published Dispelling the Glute Myth,\nhis first of 37 articles to date here at this site.\n \n<img width=\"70%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/girl-dead.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\nOur staff spent the next year (2010) experimenting with some\nof the exercises Bret introduced, making sure they were safe and effective. I\noriginally had my concerns with shear stress during bilateral hip thrusts, but\nover time, learned that it was just like any other exercise – if cued\ncorrectly, risk was dramatically reduced.\nIn 2011, we started working them into clients’ programs more\nregularly, but it wasn’t until 2012 that loaded supine bridges and hip thrusts\nbecame mainstays in the majority of our programs at Cressey Performance. The\nresults were outstanding.\nThey’re great alternatives to squatting and deadlifting for those with a history of back pain.\nThey’re awesome options for training the posterior chain in\nthose with shoulder conditions that may be exacerbated by certain squat and\ndeadlift variations (more on this later).\nThey’re less coaching-intensive exercises that athletes can pick up relatively easily in a short amount of time.\nThey don’t create a lot of soreness because you can minimize\nthe eccentric component, so they’re a useful option for in-season athletes.\nMost importantly, though, the feedback from clients and\nathletes was excellent. They felt more direct carryover to sprinting, and there\nwas a lot more complaining from male athletes who had to buy new jeans because\ntheir asses were getting too big.\nAt the end of the day, my experiences with Bret over the\npast three years taught me more than just a few new exercises and the rationale\nfor their inclusion, though. Bret taught me that if you have worked hard to\nbecome an expert in your chosen field of study, you have an obligation to\nyourself and your industry to be wildly persistent – even if it means being a pain in the ass.\nThere are a lot of great ideas out there that have never\nmade it to the public eye because the innovators weren’t good marketers of\nthemselves or their ideas.\nAdditionally, Bret taught me to never throw an idea out\nbecause it wasn’t tastefully presented. Think of it this way: I could go to a\ndinner party with some non-medical types and drop a bunch of fancy anatomy and\nphysiology words and likely convince people that I’m a cardiologist. I’d be\nfull of shit, though, and you wouldn’t want me doing your open-heart surgery.\nThat’s our world, though – there are many people who sweet-talk a lot, yet know very little.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there are bright, talented\nfolks who might not present themselves well in conversation, so it’s easy to\nmiss their messages. So, don’t be too quick to judge an idea as bad or good.\nThanks, Bret, for all the lessons.\n3. Deadlifts aren’t always okay for those with shoulder pain.\nI always viewed deadlifts as “fair game” for those\nwith shoulder issues. In other words, short of a ruptured biceps tendon,\nshoulder issues almost never seemed to get more painful when people used deadlift variations.\nThe problem was that my line of logic didn’t take into\naccount a control group. In other words, would people who didn’t deadlift get\nout of shoulder pain more quickly than those who did? The answer, as I learned in 2012, was sometimes.\nThe folks who respond best to omitting deadlifting are those\nwho sit in a lot of scapular depression. In other words, their shoulder blades sit far too low.\n \n<img width=\"70%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/back.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe shoulder blades in this photo are both depressed and\nanteriorly tilted, so the correct postural cueing would actually be “up\nand back,” not the “down and back” cue that everyone seems to think magically gets the job done.\nThese folks usually present with incredibly stiff lats and a\nbig lordosis. Put heavy weights in their hands and you pull them into more\nscapular depression. They need more elevation just to get to the right starting\nposition, and then they need to upwardly rotate the shoulder blades to be in\nthe correct positions as they overhead press, throw a baseball, or flip the\nbird to another driver in a bout of road rage.\nMost provocative tests take place with the arm elevated, yet\ndeadlifts take place with the arms at the sides – how do we really know if we\naren’t exacerbating their issues?\nSo in 2012, we dropped deadlifts (in the short-term) from\nthe programs of folks who sat in scapular depression if they were working to\novercome shoulder pain. They came along much faster.\nFor a long time, we’ve been conditioned to believe that as\nlong as an exercise didn’t hurt, it was an acceptable exercise to use. Pain is\nour guide, right? Not necessarily. This deadlift/scapular depression example\nserves as a reminder that just because something doesn’t hurt doesn’t mean that\nit isn’t leading to more pain.\n4. Exhale fully to get more out of your anti-extension core exercises and shoulder flexion mobility drills.\nIn my What I Learned in 2010 article,\nI talked about the profound impact the Postural Restoration Institute (PRI) had\non my development as a coach. That impact continues to this day.\nOne of the central tenets of the PRI philosophy is that\nfolks who live in a gross extension pattern (forward head posture, excessive\nlordosis, anterior pelvic tilt, plantarflexed ankles, etc.) live in a constant\nstate of inhalation. In other words, they have absolutely no idea how to get air out.\nWhen you exhale, your ribs should come down, so the best\ntime to challenge this function is when the arms are flexed overhead, as folks\nwith an anterior-weight-bearing tendency will usually “flare” the\nribs up during this overhead reach.\nIt’s challenging enough for folks with these heavily\ningrained habits to get their arms overhead in a neutral spine position, but\nask them to exhale in this position and you’ll make folks feel inadequate really fast.\nHere’s a good progression you can use, from mobility drills\nto stability ones. Exhale fully at the position in each drill when the arms are\noverhead (lats are on the biggest stretch):\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYou can then progress on to using the exhale at the “lengthened” positions on stability ball and ab wheel rollouts.\n5. I was right back in 2010!\nBack in my What I Learned in 2010 article,\nin light of my experience working with high-level baseball players, I talked\nabout how I firmly believed that power was very plane-specific.\nIn other words, training power in a linear (sagittal) manner\nwouldn’t have the same transfer to rotational power sports as a program that\nemphasized power development in the frontal and transverse planes. And just\nbecause someone was good in one plane did not mean that they’d effectively\nproduce force quickly in other planes.\nLuckily for my ego, my assertions were verified by a 2012 study by Lehman, et\nal (1) that was published in the Journal\nof Strength and Conditioning Research. They found that baseball throwing\nvelocity was predicted better by rotational medicine ball throw distance and\nlateral-to-medial jump distance than by bilateral and unilateral vertical and broad jumps.\n \n\n\nJust because you can run fast or jump high doesn’t mean that\nyou can swing or throw, or vice versa. Specificity is important.\n6 and 7. “Free scapula” pressing improves your bench press, and landmine presses are awesome.\nSeveral years ago on T Nation, Bill Hartman and Mike\nRobertson co-authored a great article, Push-ups, Face Pulls, and Shrugs.\nOne of their key points was that for optimal upper extremity health, you need a\nhealthy balance of pressing exercises like push-ups where the scapula moves\nfreely to “counteract” exercises like bench presses where the\nshoulder blades are fixed in place. I couldn’t agree more.\nI’m not sure that Bill and Mike scratched the surface when\nit comes to the awesome performance and physique benefits that can come from “free\nscapula pressing” initiatives, though. They focused heavily on push-up\nvariations – and rightfully so, as these are must-have exercises in just about\nany training program. However, landmine presses didn’t get any love.\n \n\n\nWe use landmine presses a lot with our throwing athletes\nbecause they allow the scapula to upwardly rotate effectively (no bench is\nthere to lock it into place), and it’s easy for us to coach it manually by\nguiding the shoulder blade to where we want it to be.\nIf an athlete is stuck in scapular depression, we can cue\nhim up a bit and add a shrug at the top. If he’s elevated and anteriorly\ntilted, we can guide him to posteriorly tilt the shoulder blade. We can work to\nmake the movement look perfect in everyone.\nThis is probably one reason why my bum shoulder – which\nalways gets cranky with overhead pressing – can tolerate landmine presses.\nMoreover, it’s slightly less elevation of the humerus, and you’re competing\nagainst a bit less gravity than when you overhead press.\nI’ve often heard accomplished bench pressers say that their\nnumbers took off when they started overhead pressing. I noticed the same thing\nwhen I started landmine presses, which makes me think it has a lot more to do\nwith the freedom of scapular motion than it does with the overhead motion.\nTruth be told, a landmine press is likely more specific to a bench press anyway.\nAs added bonuses, you also strengthen the anterior core,\nimprove rotary stability, and enhance thoracic spine mobility by doing these\none arm at a time. You can do them half-kneeling, tall-kneeling, standing, or\nsplit-stance, too, so they’re something that can be included in just about any\nprogram. All you need is a barbell and a corner into which you can shove it.\n8. Structural abnormalities are now part of normal physical development in today’s athletes.\nIn “What I Learned in 2011,” I commented on how the basics were more important than ever\nbecause we’re actually de-evolving.\nSpecifically, “Today’s population grew up sitting too much, competing too much, and preparing too\nlittle, and they always, always, always got participation trophies. They de-evolved,\nand the correction – both physically and psychologically – needs to take place now.”\nIn 2012, I had two kids under the age of 12 come my way with ulnar collateral ligament (elbow)\ninjuries. You can’t do a Tommy John surgery on a kid that young because the\ngrowth plates are still open.\nThis is on par with a kid blowing out an ACL playing pee-wee football – it simply shouldn’t happen. The\nfact that kids are finding a way to get injured in ways that stump orthopedic\nsurgeons is scary, and something needs to be done about it.\n \n<img width=\"70%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hs-baseball.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\nOveruse injuries from early sports specialization are off the charts, and we aren’t going to change\nthe stress that kids encounter in sports. We can, however, do a lot to impose\nsome variety in their yearly athletic calendar by mandating that they play multiple sports.\nIn his book, Never Eat Alone, author Keith Ferrazi\ntalks about how there are two guaranteed ways to win over anyone for life: take\ntheir pain away, and help their kids. In my next paragraph, I’m going to help\nyou take your kids’ pain away and help to set them up for success, so that\npretty much makes it one of the most important things you’ll ever read.\nI work with literally hundreds of professional and collegiate athletes each year. The overwhelming\nmajority of them didn’t specialize early. This is something that has been\nverified by polls of the top athletes in every professional sport. Anecdotally,\nI see more injuries in the ones who did specialize early,\nas they’ve acquired structural abnormalities that later “reach threshold”\nwhen they compete at faster speeds.\nIt would be extremely challenging to argue that, in the past decade of early sports specialization,\nthe U.S. has improved more than other nations on the world athletic scene. It\nsimply isn’t true, and what’s perhaps more alarming is a U.S. News and World Report article\nthat proposes that we’re actually remarkably inferior to other affluent, developed countries at\ndeveloping Olympic medalists, when you consider population size and gross domestic product (GDP).\nAnd even if we had blown everyone else’s doors off, it would be hard to justify the injury costs in our\nadolescents that we paid along the way. I can tell you that in the past five\nyears alone, the “average” movement quality I see on an initial\nevaluation with a teenage athlete has gotten worse.\nSo with all this in mind, with a large readership of parents here at T Nation, here’s my two-part direct\nchallenge to parents:\nUp to the age of 16, make sure your kids play at least two sports per year. Neither of those\nsports can be played for more than nine months out of the year. After age 16,\nyou get some wiggle room, but there still needs to be time off.\nGet kids involved in a strength and conditioning program at a younger age. My experience has been\nthat age 12-13 is a good time, depending on psychological maturity. Before that\nage, find ways to make exercise fun and productive. Expose kids to a wide\nvariety of activities and encourage free play.\nYou’ll build better athletes and keep them healthy in the process. I’d bet my career on it.\n\nConclusion\nSo, have I evolved into a wise old bastard, or what?\nThat’s the great thing about athletic training – you never stop discovering new things and you never stop learning."
