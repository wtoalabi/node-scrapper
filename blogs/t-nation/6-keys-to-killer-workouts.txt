"One Of Those Days\nEver had one of those days where you just couldn’t get into the flow of\nyour workout? Or worse yet, you don’t even make it to the gym? It’s happened\nto all of us before. The mind is willing, but the body just isn’t ready (or\nvice versa).\nThe truth is, you can influence how you perform in the gym several days before\nyou ever work out! I’m going to cover the things you can do from a few days\nbefore, up to the things you should be doing during your workout to maximize\nyour performance each and every time you hit the iron.\nBefore we go on, let’s take a survey here: How many of you have skipped\nworkouts in the past year? The past month? The past week? If it’s more recent,\nwhat was the exact cause for missing your workout?\nSure, there are legitimate reasons for missing workouts (illness, emergency,\nfamily obligations), but I’m talking about either just being too lazy to\nworkout or not being motivated to work out. (And yes, there’s a difference!)\nMy goal with this article is twofold:\n1) To help you miss fewer workouts over the course of the coming weeks,\nmonths, and years.\n2) To help you have better workouts over the course of the coming\nweeks, months, and years.\nWhat I’m going to do is outline what I do to maximize my performance in\neach and every workout. I’ve also used this scheme with many clients and\nathletes with excellent results. Simply put, more productive workouts lead\nto more muscle, less fat, better performance, and overall improvements in\nyour strength and physique.\nLet’s jump into this and see what you can use to have better workouts more\nconsistently!\nKey #1: Visualization\nI’m sure some of you are going to flip out and say that this is hocus-pocus.\nBut I’ll also guarantee that a large percentage of successful lifters and\nathletes use some sort of visualization technique.\nI remember in my younger years reading an article about Robby Robinson and\nhis deadlift workouts. Robbie talked about getting prepped for this workout\na day or two in advance. He’d go through the lifts in his head, think about\nwhat weights he wanted to use, and imagine himself grinding out flawless\nreps that would give him the physique he wanted.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001-11.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"270\"/>\n\n\n Robby Robinson\nI also remember reading about how Clyde “The Glide”\nDrexler would use visualization before every basketball game. He’d visualize\nthe moves he wanted to make, how the game would come to him, and most importantly, him\nsucceeding!\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image003-11.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"438\"/>\n\n\n Clyde Drexler\nI firmly believe that visualization is a powerful tool that’ll help you\nimprove your performance. There are tons of articles out there on visualization,\nbut one of the most important things you need to do is make it as realistic\nas possible. Imagine the scene in the gym, what it’s going to smell like,\nthe music pumping in your ears. Feel the knurling on the bar and imagine\nhow light it feels when you get as tight as possible. It sounds silly, but\nthis kind of visualization can definitely improve your training!\nNext, make sure that you envision yourself succeeding. I’ve mentioned that\npoint twice now and for a reason. Many people are so caught up on certain\nnumbers or goals that they’re actually beaten before they enter the gym!\nThey simply can’t imagine themselves being that strong or having the body\nthey really want. You must do everything possible to eradicate this negative\nself-image and re-write it with a new, more positive one.\nFor big workouts, I’ll typically start thinking about it the night or two\nbefore going to bed and again upon waking the day of the workout. For powerlifting\nmeets, it’s basically all I think about for the entire week. Just remember,\nyou’re not stressing over it, just constantly envisioning a successful performance.\nKey #2: Review Your Goals\nWhenever I need an extra boost of motivation, all I need to do is check\nout my current goals and I’m ready to rock. Am I stronger than the average\nmember of society? Sure. Am I as strong as I want to be? Hell no. Have I\nachieved all my lifting-related goals? Not even close. But I’m on my way.\nYou do have goals, right? If not, that alone could be the reason you haven’t\nbeen having great workouts, or simply skipping sessions altogether. If we\ndon’t have goals then what are we training for? Just to “be healthy?” If\nthat’s the case, you wouldn’t be reading this article.\nIf you don’t have goals, take the time right now to write some up. I want\nyou to write at least three goals, all of which are:\n1. Very specific\n2. Measurable\n3. Time sensitive\nThen, get your action plan together.\nThe Action Plan\nNow, here’s where most people go wrong: they stop after setting a goal.\nA goal is great, but it doesn’t give you the road between here (where you\nare now) and there (where you want to be). This is why you need an action\nplan!\nBasically, an action plan describes exactly what you need to do to achieve\nyour goals. Here’s an example of a strength goal and action plan:\nGoal: Squat 500 pounds by December 31, 2006 (currently squatting 450).\nAction Plan: Increase leg strength via more glute-hams, lunges, Bulgarian\nsquats, and step-ups. Strengthen core with more heavy ab work (windmills,\nweighted pillars, heavy side-bends, weighted crunches, etc.). Perform a leg-strengthening\nME exercise two times a month. Perform speed squats at least three times\na month to focus on improving speed and technique.\nNow let’s look at a physique-related goal and action plan:\nGoal: Decrease body fat by 3% by December 31, 2006.\nAction Plan: Eat meals/snacks every 2-3 hours (set watch if necessary).\nEat some protein with every feeding and perform cardio at least three times\na week. Measure with calipers every two weeks to determine progress and reassess\nhow things are going.\nThese are somewhat general examples, but they should give you an idea of\nhow to not only set goals, but how to setout a plan to achieve your goals\ntime and again. Having a solid program that’s geared toward your goals will\ngive you the confidence to train your hardest and know that the results will\ncome.\nKey #3: Stimulants\nStimulants are good, especially if you want to have a great workout. I don’t\nsubscribe to using them year-round or for every training session, but for\nbig workouts where you want a kick-in-the-pants, they can be invaluable.\nWhat kind of stimulant should you use? That’s really up to you. For the\npast year I’ve been using Dr. John Berardi’s recommendation of green tea\npre-workout. It’s got just enough caffeine to dial me in without making me\nover-anxious. I also love the health benefits associated with it, so I’m\nalways trying to figure out ways to get more green tea into my diet.\nWhat I’ll do upon waking is eat breakfast and brew a nice hot cup of green\ntea. After breakfast and while drinking the tea, I’ll listen to some key\nmusic (discussed below) and visualize the performance of my session. Basically,\nI just want 10-15 minutes to get myself dialed in and ready to train.\nFinally, I firmly believe that the heat from the green tea helps promote\nan increase in core temperature and reduces time needed to warm-up.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image005-2.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"/>\n\n\nHowever, if it’s a really big session or competition, I want that edge over\neveryone else. In this case I’ll go with some sort of very potent coffee\n(such as espresso) or Spike.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Spike-50-Tablets-LUM.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"544\"/>\n\n\nKey #4: Warm-Up!\nSo now we’ve visualized our workout, reviewed our action plan and goals,\nand infused some stimulants into our system. Now it’s time to get going.\nEven if you’re feeling lazy and don’t want to workout, try this:\nGo to the gym and tell yourself, “I’m just going to warm-up. If I don’t\nfeel better and ready to train after I warm-up, I’ll go home for the day.”\nI’ve used this trick with myself and with my athletes, and I’d say it has\na 99% success rate. Really! You get moving, the stimulants start to kick\nin, the endorphins start flowing, and all of a sudden the last thing you\nwant to do is go home and sit on your ass. It’s a beautiful thing.\nNow, let’s get to the most efficient/effective ways to warm-up!\nPassive Means\nFirst off, if it’s cold out, you better bundle up and get some freaking\nclothes on. If not, you’re either going to have a terrible session because\nyou never feel “warmed-up” or you’re going to injure yourself.\nOne of my favorite means of passively warming-up is heat liniment. All you\ndo is buy the hottest stuff you can stand, rub it on your joints/muscles,\nand wait for it to do the trick. In just five minutes it’s going to feel\nlike you’ve been teleported to balmy Las Vegas in the dead of summer.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image009-2.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\"/>\n\n\nAnother great option here is compressive garments such as knee sleeves,\nbiking shorts (under your real shorts please!) or elbow sleeves. These items\nare great for keeping tissue temperature up around your joints, especially\nif you’re taking long periods of rest between sets. I’ve been wearing the\nRehband knee sleeves for two years now and I’ll never squat again without\nthem. They really are that good.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image011-2.png\" width=\"372\" height=\"288\"/>\n\n\nIf you have a short drive to the gym or are in a hurry to get started, you\ncan even apply the liniment and/or compressive garments while at home to\nsave time. Trust me, by the time you hit the gym, your body will be steaming\nhot!\nActive Means – General Warm-up\nThere’s been a lot of discussion about warming-up lately, and rightfully\nso. Not only is it an underappreciated topic, it’s also a misunderstood topic.\nI know that some are from the camp of “If a bear attacks you in the woods,\nyou don’t have time to warm-up!” Well, I tell you what, if I meet a bear\nin the woods I’m not going to squat, bench, or deadlift him, and if I pull\na hamstring running from him I’m not going to care; I’m still going to run.\nAfter all, in an ideal world, wouldn’t we be warmed-up before running into\nold Smoky?\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image013-1.png\" width=\"212\" height=\"252\"/>\n\n\nSeriously, warming-up is important. If you value the long-term health of\nyour muscles, joints, and body in general, I hope you’re warming up before\nyou put a couple hundred pounds on your back and squat it below parallel.\nThe only real question is, what’s the best way to warm-up?\nScientific research leads us to believe that a dynamic, movement-oriented\nwarm-up going through full ranges of motion is the best option available.\nEric Cressey and I outline over thirty exercises in our Magnificent Mobility DVD.\nIt’s the only resource you’ll need on the topic.\nActive Means – Specific Warm-up\nHere are some general rules I like to adhere to:\n• Use the general and passive means to improve core temperature. This\nshouldn’t be done using your core lifts!\n• Perform some light and gradual warm-ups with whatever your\n“core” exercise is for the day (squat, bench, deadlift, chin-up, etc.).\n• Perform enough repetitions to groove the technique and performance of\nthe lift, without tiring yourself out.\nThis isn’t rocket science, but I often see people who do endless warm-ups\nwith weights too close to their work sets. By the time they’re actually ready\nto perform said work sets, they’re toast!\nWhen in doubt, think of it like this: The passive means and general warm-up\nare what physically increase core temperature and\n“warm you up,” while the specific warm-up is more for grooving technique\nand getting you mentally ready to move some heavy iron. Hopefully this clears\nthings up a bit.\nKey #5: Music\nMusic is one of the most potent motivators you have in your arsenal. For\nthose of you training in a commercial facility, I have one word for you:\niPod.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image015-2.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"/>\n\n\nUp until this point in my life, I’ve never had to train in a true “commercial” facility.\nWhile a small part of me dies each time I train there, I’ve learned to survive\nby scowling at all the people who look my way and turning my iPod up to ear-drum\nshattering levels.\nNow, while I’m admittedly not as hardcore as some of you out there, I still\nappreciate the training effects of solid heavy metal music. If you’re looking\nfor decent training music, here’s just a small sample of groups that can\nhelp you out:\nMetallica (older stuff only)\nGodsmack\nRob Zombie\nRage Against the Machine\nAC/DC\nDMX\n2Pac\nCeline Dion (kidding!)\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image017-1.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\n\n\nAgain, this is just what works for me, but I know that these musicians alone\nhave gotten me through a large number of my training sessions in the past\nfew years. Good music equals good workouts.\nKey #6: Make It Routine!\nThis could be the most important bit of advice. The more I read about great\nathletes, the more I understand about how much they revel in developing and\nfollowing a routine. You’d be wise to do the same.\nNo matter what keys you choose to apply from above, if you make them into\nyour own individual routine, your body will know exactly when to perform\neach and every time you ask it to. Simply put, you should strive to make\nyour pre and peri-workout ritual the same each and every time you train.\nConsistency in your routine pre-workout will lead to consistent performance during your\nworkout.\nSummary\nHopefully I’ve outlined a few things that you can put into your training\ntoolbox to get more out of your workouts. It’s nothing groundbreaking, just\nsolid advice that can help you achieve your training goals, whatever they\nmay be.\nIf you take nothing else from this article, know these two simple facts:\nFact #1: If you train more consistently, you’ll make more consistent gains.\nFact #2: If you have better workouts more consistently, you’ll make better\ngains more consistently.\nNow get your ass to the gym and have a great workout!"
