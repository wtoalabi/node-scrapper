"Sure, you’ve been doing nothing but bench presses and dumbbell curls for the last 10 years. You’re like those guys who only use the missionary position in bed and wonder why your wife or girlfriend has had one, perpetual, blue-balling headache for the last 14 months.\nWell, like your girl, your muscles are bored. It’s time to try something new. It’s time to start making progress again.\nMost of you know that heavy compound movements with a barbell are the best for size and strength. Similarly, you know that heavy presses and rows should be in every serious lifter’s chest and back routine, and some of the best options for getting massive arms are barbell curls and extensions.\nBut sometimes lifters will hit plateaus in these bread and butter lifts, caused by technique flaws, a weakness in a lagging muscle group, or just poor programming. To bust free and start progressing again, you need to switch things up, and one of the best ways is to experiment with new exercises.\nBelow is a list of the 10 best uncommon variations of basic barbell upper body exercises, compiled from strength coaches and athletes from around the country. Use these as assistance lifts or main lifts in your program.\nTwo Vertical Push (Overhead) Variations\nZ Press\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Core stability and shoulder strength\nMuscle Building Potential: Entire shoulder region and upper back\n\nThe Z press is named after strongman competitor Zydrunas Savickas. Strongman competitors are required to perform a tremendous amount of shoulder and triceps work to prepare for pressing events. This lift is great for increasing core strength and building the shoulder stability necessary to press big weights overhead.\nOne of the potential problems with standing military presses is that when the weight gets heavy, the lifter may lean back excessively to complete the repetition. This excessive lean becomes impossible when performing the Z press.\nThe core and upper back regions must be extremely stable to successfully complete a repetition, making this a great shoulder builder and core strengthening exercise.\nSet up the pins in a power rack anywhere from clavicle height to chin height and perform overhead presses while seated with the legs in front.\nSeated Overhead Pin Lockout\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Lockout strength for overhead work and strongman\nMuscle Building Potential: Triceps development\n\nSeated overhead pin lockouts are a Westside barbell staple. This is an awesome exercise for developing the triceps strength necessary for locking out big weights overhead and to support the lockout of a jerk.\nI recommend setting a bench at a slight incline (as opposed to using a vertical military bench) for comfort purposes, although both options will work.\nTwo Horizontal Pulling (Rowing) Variations\nDead-Stop Supinated Rack Rows\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Lat strength for stability in deadlift and bench press\nMuscle Building Potential: Lats and upper back development\n\nDead-stop barbell rows are one of the best back builders you aren’t doing. A problem with traditional bent over rows is that lifters often can’t stay in a good position for the entire set. By setting each rep at the pins, the lifter can keep proper back position and reset their grip as needed. Pulling each rep from a dead start will also help improve starting strength, which will transfer over to the deadlift nicely.\nOne Arm Barbell Rows\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Lat and grip strength for stability in deadlift and bench press\nMuscle Building Potential: Lats, upper back, and forearm development\n\nThe one-arm barbell row is a nice addition to a lifer’s back training routine. Using the barbell requires considerable grip strength to balance the load evenly. It’s also a great option for lifters who don’t have access to heavy dumbbells.\nTwo Horizontal Push (Bench) Variations\nBEEkers\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Builds pressing endurance\nMuscle Building Potential: Chest and triceps development\n\nBench presses for moderate to high repetitions are one of the best ways to add serious chest mass and strength endurance. This is also important for football players looking to hit huge numbers for their combine bench press test.\nPerform BEEkers like a traditional bench press except alternate a full range repetition with a repetition to a board or some other object (half foam roller shown in video) to limit the range of motion. (Yeah, I know they look a little lame, but they work!)\n“Rack ‘Ems”\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Lat strength for unracking and stabilizing big benches\nMuscle Building Potential: All pressing muscles and lats\n\n“Rack ‘Ems” is the best exercise for lifters who have trouble unracking the weight in the bench press. It’s simple to perform – just put the weight in the rack and unrack it after every bench press repetition.\nIt’s important to pull the weight out of the rack versus pressing it out of the rack – think of doing a pullover followed by a bench press. “Rack ‘Ems” help strengthen the lats, which is extremely important for stabilization in the bench press, while increasing pressing strength.\nTwo Triceps Variations\nJM Floor Press\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Lockout strength for the bench press\nMuscle Building Potential: Triceps development around the elbow\n\nThe JM press, popularized by JM Blakely, has many variations used by powerlifters worldwide. This JM Press variation is a great way to build triceps size and strength that will carry over to a big bench press.\nLifters new to the JM press often have difficulty figuring out where to stop the range of motion. Some perform these presses very shallow while others lower the bar until the forearm contacts the biceps. The floor variation makes it very easy to gauge depth – simply bring your elbows down until your triceps touch the floor, pause for one-second and explode up.\nTriangle Triceps Extensions\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Strength for locking out pressing exercises\nMuscle Building Potential: Triceps development\n\nThe triangle triceps extension is the distant cousin of the rolling dumbbell extension popularized by Westside Barbell. I first learned this movement from powerlifter Mark Bell, who has benched over 800 pounds in competition. One issue many advanced lifters have with extensions is elbow wear and tear. This variation is a little easier on the elbows. The eccentric portion of the extension – which tends to stress the elbows – is essentially eliminated.\nLower the bar to the chest like a close grip bench press, roll back toward the face, and then extend up like a regular barbell extension. Give these a try if you have elbow issues when performing extensions.\nTwo Biceps Variations\nOne Arm Barbell Curls\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Helps keep balance in the arms for strongman competitors and powerlifters\nMuscle Building Potential: Biceps\n\nDirect arm training is important for overall strength and size development. The one-arm barbell curl is a great option for advanced lifters with limited equipment.\nThis is a great biceps variation if you don’t have access to a dumbbell but still want to do one-arm curls. Much like the one-arm barbell row this exercise is hard to stabilize and will challenge the lifter’s grip much more than a traditional curl, in addition to the core muscles.\nPower Curls\n \n\n\n\nStrength Building Properties: Helps keep balance in the arms for strongman competitors and powerlifters\nMuscle Building Potential: Biceps\n\nThe power curl is a great alternative to the cheat curl. Set up like a sumo deadlift and use the hips to drive the weight up to a standing position and then lower under control. This is a good way to use more weight than normally used on a barbell curl while sparing the low back, which can be exceedingly overused with cheat curls.\nTo really benefit from the power curl, concentrate on the eccentric portion and lower the weight under control.\nPutting it All Together\nInterested to see whether your physique might benefit from a break from the same old lifts?
