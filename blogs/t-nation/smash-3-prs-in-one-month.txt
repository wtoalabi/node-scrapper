"Here’s what you need to know…\n\nMost lifters train the assistance lifts only with higher reps. That’s a mistake.\nIncreasing strength in these accessory muscles is key to overall strength, athletic performance, and developing muscle density and size.\nWhen training the assistance lifts for strength, continue to hit the big lifts heavy and hard to foster an anabolic environment.\n\n“Train movements, not muscles.” This has been the rallying cry of the post-Schwarzenegger, functional fitness-crazed era.\nAnd it’s solid advice, for the most part. You’ll get bigger and stronger by improving your squat, deadlift, pull-up, and overhead press than by doing endless sets of concentration curls and seated calf raises.\nSo in pursuit of training more like an athlete, isolation movements for smaller muscle groups have been relegated to the back of the classroom, deemed only appropriate as “assistance” work that we sneak in if we have time and energy after 10 sets of 3 of the front squat.\nThat’s a mistake.\nBy keeping our training for smaller muscle groups like triceps, calves, and hamstrings in the higher rep ranges, we’ve lost our ability to produce maximal strength – strength that will improve performance in the big lifts while leading to greater muscle size.\nWhat We Know\nWhile genetics play the biggest role in muscle fiber-type distribution, in most people the hamstrings and the triceps are composed primarily of a variety of Type-II muscle fibers.\nThese are the fiber types most responsible for explosive power and strength, and to see them in action, look at high-level sprinters and powerlifters, respectively.\nSprinters, particularly those competing in shorter events, have incredibly well developed and powerful hamstrings. And drop by a powerlifting gym and you’ll see that the world’s best bench pressers have triceps that are about as big as the average guy’s quads.\nOf course, size isn’t the only factor, particularly in muscle groups that are either primarily Type-I dominant or are composed of mixed fiber-types.\nFor example, many of the world’s best leapers don’t have huge calf development despite the gastrocnemius and soleus playing a role in jumping, but obviously they have great explosive calf strength.\nAnecdotally, I’ve helped many people increase biceps size and pulling strength by using lower rep biceps curl variations.\nThe point is, increasing strength in these accessory muscles is key to strength, sports performance, and developing muscle density and size.\nHow To Do It\nBefore you start testing your 1RM in the seated hamstring curl, understand that doing a bunch of singles isn’t the best way to develop strength in these muscle groups.\nSince we’re talking about isolation movements and there’s minimal load sharing across several muscle groups, straining a tendon or pulling a muscle is a serious concern. Therefore, we’ll never go below three reps when training these muscle groups directly.\nAnd remember, just because you’re training the smaller muscles for strength doesn’t mean you should abandon the big lifts or make a triceps rope pressdown your A1 exercise. Large compound lifts allow you to use more overall load and set the stage for an anabolic hormonal environment, so don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater.\nThe Program\nHere’s a simple, 3 times per-week training program that works on both maximal and relative strength while using compound lifts and exercises that focus on smaller muscle groups.\nStart this training phase by testing your 1RM in the deadlift, weighted chin-up, and overhead press or bench press. At the end, you’ll go back and retest your 1RM so you’ll have empirical proof that training in this manner has made you stronger than ever.\nBe sure to test your maxes on a day when you’re not doing any other training, or at least before doing any other training.\nChoosing the appropriate load is critical. You want to make sure you’re using max or near max weight for each set, meaning that you should be able to complete all sets using a weight that will allow you to only complete the number of reps in that set.\nIf needed, err on the side of caution and use a weight that gives you one more rep in the tank. Add weight to movements such as the chin-ups and glute-ham raises as needed.\nOnce you’ve established your 1RMs, you’re ready for the program.\nWeek 1\nDay One\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nDeadlift\n5\n5\n90 sec.\n\n\nB1\nLying Hamstring Curl\n4\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nBarbell Floor Press\n4\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nStanding Barbell Biceps Curl\n3\n6\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nSeated Calf Raise\n3\n6\n60 sec.\n\n\nDay Two\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nStrict Press\n5\n5\n90 sec.\n\n\nB1\nDecline EZ-Bar Triceps Extension\n4\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nGlute-Ham Raise\n4\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nStaggered-Stance Single Leg Romanian Deadlift\n3\n6/side\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nSeated Dumbbell Hammer Curl\n3\n6\n60 sec.\n\n\nDay Three\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nWeighted Chin-Up\n5\n5\n90 sec.\n\n\nB1\nDonkey Calf-Raise on Leg Press\n4\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nWeighted Dip\n4\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nIncline Dumbbell Biceps Curl\n3\n6/side\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nKneeling Overhead Cable Triceps Extension w/Rope Attachment\n3\n6\n60 sec.\n\n\nWeek 2\nDay One\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nDeadlift\n8\n3\n120 sec.\n\n\nB1\nLying Hamstring Curl\n6\n4\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nBarbell Floor Press\n6\n4\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nStanding Barbell Biceps Curl\n2\n5\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nSeated Calf Raise\n2\n5\n60 sec.\n\n\nDay Two\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nStrict Press\n8\n3\n120 sec.\n\n\nB1\nDecline EZ-Bar Triceps Extension\n6\n4\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nGlute-Ham Raise\n6\n4\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nStaggered-Stance Single Leg Romanian Deadlift\n2\n5/side\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nSeated Dumbbell Hammer Curl\n2\n5\n60 sec.\n\n\nDay Three\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nWeighted Chin-Up\n8\n3\n120 sec.\n\n\nB1\nDonkey Calf-Raise on Leg Press\n6\n4\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nWeighted Dip\n6\n4\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nIncline Dumbbell Biceps Curl\n2\n5/side\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nKneeling Overhead Cable Triceps Extension w/Rope Attachment\n2\n5\n60 sec.\n\n\nWeek 3\nDay One\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nDeadlift\n10\n2\n120 sec.\n\n\nB1\nLying Hamstring Curl\n5\n3\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nBarbell Floor Press\n5\n3\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nStanding Barbell Biceps Curl\n3\n5\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nSeated Calf Raise\n3\n5\n60 sec.\n\n\nDay Two\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nStrict Press\n10\n2\n120 sec.\n\n\nB1\nDecline EZ-Bar Triceps Extension\n5\n3\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nGlute-Ham Raise\n5\n3\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nStaggered-Stance Single Leg Romanian Deadlift\n3\n5/side\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nSeated Dumbbell Hammer Curl\n3\n5\n60 sec.\n\n\nDay Three\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nWeighted Chin-Up\n10\n2\n120 sec.\n\n\nB1\nDonkey Calf-Raise on Leg Press\n5\n3\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nWeighted Dip\n5\n3\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nIncline Dumbbell Biceps Curl\n3\n5/side\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nKneeling Overhead Cable Triceps Extension w/Rope Attachment\n3\n5\n60 sec.\n\n\nWeek 4\nDay One\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nDeadlift\n6\n4\n90 sec.\n\n\nB1\nLying Hamstring Curl\n3\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nBarbell Floor Press\n3\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nStanding Barbell Biceps Curl\n2\n8\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nSeated Calf Raise\n2\n8\n60 sec.\n\n\nDay Two\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nStrict Press\n6\n4\n120 sec.\n\n\nB1\nDecline EZ-Bar Triceps Extension\n3\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nGlute-Ham Raise\n3\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nStaggered-Stance Single Leg Romanian Deadlift\n2\n8/side\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nSeated Dumbbell Hammer Curl\n2\n8\n60 sec.\n\n\nDay Three\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\nRest\n\n\nA\nWeighted Chin-Up\n6\n4\n120 sec.\n\n\nB1\nDonkey Calf-Raise on Leg Press\n3\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nB2\nWeighted Dip\n3\n6\n75 sec.\n\n\nC1\nIncline Dumbbell Biceps Curl\n2\n8/side\n60 sec.\n\n\nC2\nKneeling Overhead Cable Triceps Extension w/Rope Attachment\n2\n8\n60 sec.\n\n\nThe Proof Is In The Press\nAfter completing the program, rest for two days and then retest your 1RM in the deadlift, weighted chin-up, and strict press.
