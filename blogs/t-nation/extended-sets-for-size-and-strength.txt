"It’s human nature to gravitate towards the path of least resistance, especially in the fitness world. It’s the reason why some will blindly follow a generic machine-based workout that an overly upbeat training/sales staff person gave them when they signed up, often for months on end.\nThese “mail it in” type of trainees make up about 30 percent of the people you’ll see toiling away in a typical commercial fitness factory. Whether they got their cookie cutter program from a trainer, a magazine, or off the back of a cereal box, they dutifully follow it to the letter, piss poor results and all.\nAnother 65 percent of lifters would put Biggie Smalls to shame. They’re freestyle masters, and random training phases complement their capricious mentalities. However, though they may be lifting hard, usually they’re not lifting smart. Their gym ventures tend to be punctuated with poor exercise choices and a sophomoric gym-rat mentality, not to mention God-awful technique.\nThen there’s the remaining 5 percent – those who train with purpose and thought behind their programming. If you’re on this site, you’re likely one of them.\nSo when it comes to using advanced lifting methods, such as extended sets, you don’t want to just “throw ’em in because they’re cool.” You need to know which ones build muscle, increase strength, strip off fat, or just inject some much-needed variety.\nThis article will focus on using extended sets for the purposes of getting bigger and stronger.\nSize Training\nBodybuilders talk about training for “the pump.” Increasing blood volume and ultimately promoting sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is something that separates bodybuilding training from other training styles.\nTo maximize this effect by way of extended sets, we need to find ways to exhaust the muscle by performing as many reps as possible with a supposed “max.”\n1 – The Classic Drop-Set\nThis is likely the first “advanced” size-training strategy ever developed. Drop-sets are simple. Take one exercise, say biceps curls. Do a set of 6 reps with close to your max effort for that many reps, and then immediately grab a pair of lighter dumbbells. Perform 8 reps or so. Finally, grab an even lighter pair and rep out to mechanical failure.\nI’d use this method with training clients who have some size training experience, but not years’ worth. It’s a simple, relatively effective exhaustion technique.\nOf course, everything has its disadvantages, and in this case it relates to fast twitch versus slow twitch muscle fibers. Since our fast twitch fibers are the most explosive fibers, we want to tap into them primarily to improve our size and strength.\nHowever, after the first “drop” of a standard drop-set, due to their short energy span, the fast-twitch muscle fibers should technically begin to drop out of the lifting effort for the second and third phases of the lift. So we’re achieving exhaustion but we aren’t putting our fast twitch fibers to the best use.\nOn top of this, since the load is decreasing, we don’t get to keep the resistance above 70 percent of our max for the whole time.\nFor these reasons, I’d recommend this method to a lifter who doesn’t use drop sets frequently, or to a lifter new to hypertrophy training.\n2 – Mechanical Drop Sets\nThe mechanical drop set is the immediate solution for extending the work set without sacrificing the weight lifted. The key lies in making minor modifications to the exercise in order to perform more reps.\nAs an example, take a barbell bench press loaded with 225 pounds. Suppose you start off using a triceps-dominant narrow grip and hit 6 reps. By quickly switching to a medium grip, you’ll be able to bang out a few more reps without adjusting the load. A final adjustment to a wide grip should allow for a few reps more.\n3 – Ladder Sets\nLadder set training addresses how drop sets tend to go stale with advanced lifters. Here’s a sample ladder set:\n\nUsing your 10 to 12 rep max in an exercise, perform 2 reps.\nRest for 10 to 15 seconds, and then immediately perform 3 more reps.\nRest for 10 to 15 seconds, and then perform 5 reps.\nRest once more for 10 to 15 seconds, then perform 10 reps.\n\nI stole this idea from the great Dan John, and I’m a big fan. The fact that you’re using the same weight through the entire set eliminates any doubt as to whether you’re still using an intensity that will promote hypertrophy benefits.\nThe fast twitch fibers get a chance to do a bit more work because their energy source (ATP) gets a partial recovery, thanks to the short mid-set “breaks.”\nBy the end of the ladder set, you’ve essentially performed 20 reps with your 10 to 12 rep max. Not too shabby.\nThis is also an awesome psychological test. Like breathing squats, you have a finite target number to reach that marks a complete set, not just “muscular failure.”\nWith each break period, you know that you have to perform more reps than you just did, though you’re under more fatigue than you were when you started.\nIt’s a way to learn to pull deep and get out a few grinders, and you’ll leave the gym feeling more accomplished than you’ve ever felt before. This rep scheme works best with the big movements like the bench press, standing press, pull-ups, weighted dips, and squats, but you can incorporate them into smaller isolation movements like leg extensions, curls, and seated dumbbell presses.\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cables.jpg\" alt=\"cables\" />\n\nStrength Training\nThere are some crossovers between size training and strength training, and using drop-sets and ladder sets will definitely give some benefit where adding strength is concerned.\nBut if you want to bench 550, you have to focus on performing more reps with as similar a load to your working weight as possible.\n4+2 Clusters\nThe 4 + 2 cluster method is an effective tool for performing more reps than you normally “could” with a heavy load.\nPut your 5-rep max on the bar for a big movement (bench press, press, deadlift, squat, weighted pull-ups), but perform only 4 reps, leaving some juice in the tank. Rack the weight and rest for 10 to 15 seconds.\nThen, immediately un-rack the load and perform as many reps as possible (this usually results in another 2 reps, and it’s a safe number to gun for). You just performed 6 reps with your 5-rep max.\nThis exposes your body to more sub-maximal efforts under high work load, and the cumulative effect is nothing but positive for lifters after strength gains.\nSingle-Rep Clusters\nTaking cluster sets right down to the rep is a smart way to expose your body to many more max efforts in a given workout. Put 90 percent of your max effort onto the bar and then perform one rep. Rest for 10 to 15 seconds, and repeat 2 to 3 more times.\nA Cool Twist: Coach Rich Sadiv came up with the “10 minute challenge,” where 30-second breaks are taken between 90 percent max single-rep efforts until ten minutes elapses.\nThe point was to take people out of “pyramid” mode and into their heavy work sets for a greater period of time, and for more total reps. Check out this article for more.\nPutting it all Together\nUsing these methods can result in some serious gains in size and strength. A program that alternates between them is just the ticket.\nSample Program Week 1: Strength\nDay 1 – Back\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nDeadlift, Single-Rep Clusters\n5\n*\n\n\nB\nWeighted Pull-Up, 4 + 2 Clusters\n4\n*\n\n\nC1\nSeated Row\n4\n12\n\n\nC2\nDumbbell Reverse Fly\n4\n12\n\n\n\n* rest 3 to 4 minutes between sets\nDay 2 – Chest\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nFlat Barbell Bench Press 10 minute Challenge @ 90%\n1\n \n\n\nB\nPin Press Set up bench on a low incline\n5*\n5\n\n\nC\nCable Chest Fly\n4\n12\n\n\n\n* rest 3 minutes between sets\nDay 3 – Legs\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nFront Squat, 4 + 2 clusters\n5*\n \n\n\nB\nRomanian Deadlift\n4* *\n6\n\n\nC\nEccentric Glute-Ham Raise\n4* * *\n6\n\n\nD\nLeg Press\n4\n12\n\n\n\n* rest 3 to 4 minutes between sets\n* * rest 3 minutes between sets\n* * * rest 2 to 3 minutes between sets\nDay 4 – Shoulders\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nStanding Press\n5*\n5\n\n\nB\nBarbell High Pull\n4*\n6\n\n\nC1\nDumbbell Lateral Raise\n4\n10\n\n\nC2\nFace Pull\n4\n12\n\n\n\n* rest 3 minutes between sets\nSample Program Week 2: Size\nDay 1 – Back\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nBent-Over Row, Ladder Set\n5\n \n\n\nB\nLat Pulldown Mechanical drop-set (wide grip, mid grip, reverse narrow grip)\n4\n \n\n\nC\nSingle-Arm Dumbbell Row\n3\n15*\n\n\nD\nStiff-Arm Pulldown\n4\n12\n\n\n\n* per arm\nDay 2 – Chest\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nBarbell Bench Press Mechanical drop set (narrow grip, mid grip, wide grip)\n4\n \n\n\nB\nSmith Machine Incline Bench Press, Ladder Set\n3*\n \n\n\nC\nStanding Cable Fly\n4\n15\n\n\n\n* Only 3 rounds are used as the mechanical drops will have already fatigued the chest.\nDay 3 – Legs\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nBarbell Back Squat, Ladder Set\n5\n \n\n\nB\nWalking Lunge\n4\n20 steps\n\n\nC\nLeg Extension, Drop Set\n4\n \n\n\nD\nLeg Press\n2\n20\n\n\nDay 4 – Shoulders\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nSeated Dumbbell Shoulder Press, Ladder Set\n4\n \n\n\nB\nPush Press\n4\n10\n\n\nC\nMechanical Drop Set Dumbbell Front Raise/Dumbbell Lateral Raise (standing)/Dumbbell Bent-Over Lateral Raise\n4\n \n\n\nD1\nFace Pull\n3\n15\n\n\nD2\nTrap-3 Raise\n3\n15\n\n\nDay 5 (optional) – Arms\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nMechanical Drop Set Preacher Curl/Hammer Curl/Standing Biceps Curl\n4\n \n\n\nB\nMechanical Drop Set EZ Bar Skullcrusher/Skullcrusher-Pullover/Skullcrusher to Chest Press (a.k.a.
