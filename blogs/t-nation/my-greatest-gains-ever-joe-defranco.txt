"Everyone’s experienced that magical patch of time where they can do no wrong in the weight room. Heavy lifts go up with ease. Muscle packs on by the pound. And you blast through plateaus and set new records.\nIt’s almost mythical – it hits, it sticks, and then it’s gone… leaving you with the greatest gains you’ve ever had.\nWe asked “the pro-maker” Joe DeFranco how he achieved his greatest gains, and asked for the program that transformed him.\n“I looked down at my hamstrings and quads and thought, ‘Oh, shit! Those muscles weren’t there before. When did that happen?’“\nJoe DeFranco, strength coach to blue-collar physique monsters and professional athletes alike, knew he had the near-perfect leg program to achieve the ultimate balance of esthetics and power. All it needed was some tweaking.\n“I found the Westside powerlifting method, changed a few things to get more quad development, tried it out on myself for three weeks, and was shocked with how quickly I added muscle,” he says. “Now, 95 percent of my guys are doing some version of that first wicked experiment. Their legs have never been bigger or stronger.”\nThe beauty and effectiveness lies in the simplicity of the program. It’s good ol’ fashioned hard work, complete with bar-bending weight, screaming intensity, and some crying and vomiting thrown in for good measure. Just the way DeFranco likes it.\n“It looks pretty basic on paper, but man, this mini-cycle kicked my ass,” admits DeFranco. “Try it for three weeks and I bet you’ll add an inch to your legs and ten pounds or more to your squat.”\nDeFranco’s Three-Week Leg Cure\nYou’ll train your lower body only one day per week, with four exercises, to achieve one goal: massive, powerful legs.\nBox Squat\n \n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Box_Squat-1.jpg\" alt=\"Box Squat\" />\n\n“This is hands-down the best version of the squat I’ve found to add some serious weight to the bar and serious muscle to your body,” says DeFranco.\nWhile DeFranco has used Olympic squats and leg presses to build decent-sized quads, they never did much for his hamstrings.\n“I looked in the mirror and just didn’t see the amount of muscle I would’ve liked,” he says. But after reading about the box squat and the success Louie Simmons and the rest of the Westside crew had with it, he decided to give it a try.\n“Having the box behind me triggered something in my brain to sit back and really stretch the hamstrings,” he says.\nAccording to DeFranco a box squat is superior for a few different reasons. “You can load the bar with a ton of weight and maintain perfect form while making sure you have the proper depth with every squat.”\nThe Three-Week Leg cure calls for some brutally heavy sets, but DeFranco also threw in a hellish, give-it-everything-you’ve-got set that’s sure to have you lying on the floor after you rack the bar.\nEccentric Natural Glute-Ham Raise\n \n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Eccentric_Natural_Glute-Ham_Raise.jpg\" alt=\"Eccentric Natural Glute-Ham Raise\" />\n\nWhen done properly and with a controlled eccentric, this variation of the classic glute-ham raise will have you gritting your teeth.\n“I love watching the facial expressions when guys first try these,” laughs DeFranco. “It’s fucking brutal.”\nTo do these, either hook your heels underneath a bench or power rack or have a training partner hold your ankles. Lower yourself as slowly as possible and then do an explosive push-up to push yourself part of the way back up; that’s where your glutes and hamstrings take over to finish the movement.\nBesides adding slabs of muscle to the back of your legs, the natural glute-ham raise has another benefit for athletes.\n“This is probably the best exercise for preventing hamstring pulls,” says DeFranco. “The combination of strengthening your hamstrings while they’re stretched makes them virtually bullet-proof.”\nSingle-leg “Speed Skater” Squat\n \n<img src=\"https://www.t-nation.com/system/publishing/article_assets/4536/original/Single-leg_'Speed_Skater'_Squat.jpg\" alt=\"Single-leg 'Speed Skater' Squat\" />\n\n“This is the first exercise that gave me the same burn as leg extensions,” says DeFranco. “So you’re getting a nice pump but you’re also recruiting more total motor units since your glutes and hamstrings are working hard. Your legs will be on fire.”\nAnd to make it even more of a bitch, DeFranco likes to place the front foot on an elevated box to increase the range of motion (which also increases the amount of profanity spewed by his athletes).\nSeated Calf Raise\nNo groundbreaking ideas here, just straight-up honesty. “I did seated calf raises because my legs were so burned out that I could barely stand,” says DeFranco.\nInstead of counting reps, DeFranco concentrated on doing as many as he could with good form and a controlled eccentric, moving continuously for 60 seconds.\nThe Program\nWeek One\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nBox Squat\n5\n5\nALAN\n\n\nB\nBox Squat Burnout with 75% of 1RM\n1\nAMAP\n3 min.\n\n\nC\nEccentric Natural Glute-Ham Raise\n2\n5\n3 min.\n\n\nD\nSingle Leg Speed-Skater Squats\n3\n10\n2 min.\n\n\nE\nSeated Calf Raise\n2\n1 min.\n1 min.\n\n\n\nALAN — As Long As Needed\nAMAP — As Many As Possible\nNotes for Week One:\n\nBox Squat  Increase the weight on each set.
