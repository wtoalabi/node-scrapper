"When it comes to exercise performance, especially the more exotic movements I often prescribe, most people grasp the big picture but miss the finer points. To remedy this, I created this “toolbox” series to help experienced lifters fill in the blanks and newer lifters learn about some very effective exercises. Here’s the newest installment! \n\nReverse Band Barbell Toss\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001-2.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"289\"/>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image002-2.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"312\"/>\n\n\nCategory: Dynamic Effort – Supplemental \nMuscles Targeted: Chest, Shoulders, and Triceps \nExercise Description: I’ve seen bench press throws prescribed by several\ncoaches over the years, but personally I never liked the idea of tossing\na barbell up in the air and catching it. A medicine ball is one thing, but\na barbell crashing down on my head is totally different. Trust me, if it\nwas to hit anyone on the head it would be me!\nI did, however, like the idea of teaching the body to absorb force and the\ndynamic effect of pressing through the lift with zero deceleration. So a\nfew years ago I set up this modified version that’ll provide some of the\nsame effects (but not entirely the same because of the reduced loading and\nintensity). \nHere’s what you do. Set the barbell up in the rack with a set of Jump\nStretch average bands.  I like to have people start with what\nI call “balanced weight.”\nThis is the weight it takes to zero out the bar right above your chest. With\na 7.5 foot rack, this will be around 115 pounds. At this weight the barbell\nwill hover right at your chest level. \nWhen you have this weight loaded, rack the bar in the J-cups and position\nyourself to bench press. Unrack the bar and lower it to your chest as you\nwould a bench press. Perform a few reps to get used to the weight (it’ll\nbe very light). After a few reps, toss the bar a few inches out of your hands\nand catch it on the down stroke. \nNow just release and catch. Try tossing a little higher each rep but control\nthe force you toss with. This will be a high rep movement (in the 20-30 range).\nWith each set add more weight. How much you add will be up to you and what\nyour comfort level is. Remember, the goal is to not smash yourself\nin the face. Use the pins and/or spotters just in case, and keep the weight\nat a moderate level. \nThis isn’t intended to replace your normal dynamic bench work, but as an\nadditional or supplemental movement. I’ve had great luck using this movement\nfor shoulder and pec rehabilitation. \n\nPure Cable Flyes on Incline\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image003-2.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"299\"/>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image004-2.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"318\"/>\n\n\nCategory: Supplemental \nMuscles Targeted: Pecs \nExercise Description: This is one I tried for the first time a few days\nago. Dr. Ryan Smith has been making the trip out to bench with us, so I’ve\nbeen using his expertise to come up with new movements that’ll help build\nand stabilize my pecs and shoulders. I come up with the stuff and then ask\nhis advice. Right away I knew this movement was a winner. \nSince I’ve torn or injured my pecs more times than I’ve seen Paris Hilton\non TV, I’ve been looking for a movement that would completely isolate the\npec region without having to rely on a one dimensional pec-deck machine. \nTo do this movement you’ll need to get some type of ankle\ncuff.\nI personally like the leather version but have had a hard time finding them,\nso nylon may be the best bet. I also found the incline bench to offer a better\nrange of motion with the cable than a flat bench. \nAttach a strap to each wrist and get on the bench. Keep your chest up high\nin the air like you have a string on your sternum pulling you toward the\nceiling. Now do your flyes. Since you’re not holding a dumbbell or cable\nhandle, you can’t lead with your hands or use your forearms to aid in\nthe movement. You feel the pecs working right from the start and continue\nthroughout the entire range.  \n\nBarbell Good Morning\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image006-2.jpg\" width=\"331\" height=\"400\"/>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image007.jpg\" width=\"307\" height=\"400\"/>\n\n\nCategory: Max Effort and Supplemental \nMuscles Targeted: Lower Back, Hamstrings, and Glutes\nExercise Description: If you haven’t guessed by now, I love the good mornings.\nI feel everyone should do some form of this movement; it’s one of the best\nexercises you can do for strength development. When programmed correctly,\nit can be a huge difference maker in any program. \nI also feel that the good morning is a great form of chaos training.\nBy this I mean if you miss a squat because you fall forward, how would you\nrecover from it? Or if you fall forward while pulling a deadlift or any other\npull, how would you recover? You’d have to arch your way back into position,\nhence a good morning. \nNow what could you do to strengthen the body so this wouldn’t happen in\nthe first place? Yep, a good morning! \nTo do a good morning, place the bar across your back as you would a squat.\nTake a moderate stance. Before you lower, fill your abdomen with air and\nbrace yourself as tight as you can. Keep this tightness as you bend over\nby pushing your ass back and keeping your back in a natural arched position.\nYou’ll feel like your toes will want to come off the floor. \nWhen you reach the bottom position (just above parallel), think of arching\nyour upper back up as you drive your hips in. There will be a slight bend\nto the knee. \nTo illustrate the power of good mornings, I’ll use my wife as an example.\nTraci had some training experience while in school but this was limited to\njust messing around in the weightroom from time to time. After moving to\nColumbus to train at Westside, she’d come to meets with me to handle the\ndetails and for support. \nAt one of these meets, she was approached by Dorris Simmons (Louie’s wife)\nin regards to training at Westside. Traci didn’t want to be a powerlifter\nbut wanted to get into better shape. More importantly, she wanted to strengthen\nher lower back because of problems she was having with it. \nDuring her first visit to the club she was asked to pull a deadlift (this\nis what everyone else was doing). Her back hurt too bad to pull the bar!\nShe was then pulled off the basic Westside plan for lower body and was told\nto focus on only a few movements dealing with lower back and abs. These included\nhanging leg raises, pulldown abs, reverse hypers and good mornings. These\nmovements were done every time she stepped into the gym. \nThe first good morning session was done with a broomstick and then progressed\nto good mornings while standing on a band with the other end of the band\naround her upper traps. Her torso was the weakness and these movements were\nthe solution. \nSo how did it work? Eleven months later, she squatted 365, bench pressed\n240, and deadlifted 315… in the 123 weight class. \nThe key is to begin and train at the level you’re at. If you’re too weak\nto do a good morning, then use a broomstick until you can use a curl bar.\nThen move to a barbell and so on. Her best good morning before the meet was\n225 for three reps. \nLast note: If you use good mornings for max effort work, then I’d advise\nyou to keep the reps to 3-5. For many years I used singles and triples, and\nto this day I feel triples worked much better because the load was on the\nspine for a longer duration and the weight was lower, thus keeping the form\nand technique tighter. \n\nUpper Back Good Mornings \n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image008-3.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\"/>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image010-1.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\"/>\n\n\nCategory: Supplemental \nMuscles Targeted: Upper Back \nExercise Description: One of the other biggest weaknesses I see with lifters\nis the upper back. This causes problems coming out of the bottom of the squat\nand makes the lockout of the bench press much harder. There are many things\nto correct this, but this is one of the best I’ve seen and used. I have to\ngive credit to Louie Simmons for this one. \nYou’ll need to use a safety\nsquat bar to do this movement. \nGet under the bar, unrack the weight, and take a moderate to wide stance.\nThis is a very simple movement to do and you can use the pictures as a guide. \nStart in a standing position and let the upper back round forward as your\nhips stay in the same place. From this point, arch your upper back back into\nthe start position. I wish there was more I could say to describe this, but\nthat’s about it! \nThis is a movement where higher reps (10-15) with multiple sets (3-5) will\nwork better. Make sure to keep your upper back as tight as you can when you’re\nin the start position. To top this off, add in 15-20 shoulder shrugs at the\nend of your set. \n\nHamstring Plate Slide\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image012.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\"/>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image014-1.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\"/>\n\n\nCategory: Supplemental \nMuscles Targeted: Hamstrings \nExercise Description: We’ve been building a huge exercise index at EliteFTS.com.\nWe have three people dumping movements in this index with the goal of 1000\nmovements. One movement placed by a coach on our Q & A board, James Smith,\nis the hamstring plate slide. When I first saw this I had to give it a shot. \nTo perform it, sit on the ground with a plate in front of you (the plate\nneeds to have a lip on it). Hook your heel on the lip of the plate and slide\nback so you get a full extension on the leg. Now curl the plate to you. At\nthis point you can do one of two things: You can move your body back and\npull again or you can push the plate back with your foot and pull again. \nWhat I really like about this is there’s no eccentric loading. This makes\nit a great movement for adding extra volume to your hamstring training without\nthe need for extra recovery. \nThat’s it for this installment. Until next time, load the bar, kick some\nass, and break some records!"
