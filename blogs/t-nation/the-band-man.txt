Most coaches,\nlifters, and trainers view the bands as a means of adding resistance to barbells,\nand much has been written in regards to the application of band in dynamic\nand max effort strength development. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image001-1.jpg\" width=\"192\" height=\"462\"/>\n\n\nCoach Hartzell\nWhat most people do not realize is that this only makes up a very small\nfraction of what bands can be used for. Dick has given thousands of seminars\non the use of bands. He is actually on the road over 300 days per year spreading\nthe word on band training. \nThis is also one of the main reasons we only support and sell bands made\nby Dick’s company, Jump Stretch. I know of nobody who knows more about\nbands than Dick, so much so that I’m amazed each and every time we meet.\nHis passion for performance is what has made and continues to make Jump Strength\nthe number one source for bands. EliteFTS.com has been associated with\nJump Strength for many years and supported their products fully. This is\nalso why we sell all Jump Stretch Products. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image003-1.jpg\" width=\"199\" height=\"101\"/>\n\n\nThe “Strong Band”\nThis business relationship is the reason why I’ve met with Dick on\nso many occasions over the years. At first I thought he was out of his mind\nand that’s probably why I liked him so much. I still think he’s\nhalf nuts but the stuff he comes up with works better than anything else\nI’ve seen.\nDuring his last visit, we got on the topic of my injuries and what I was\ndoing to try and deal with them. Within minutes he began to empty his pockets\nand then take off his watch. I knew what was about to happen. I’ve seen\nthis many times before. He was about to go into a band-training rampage. \nThis time was a little different, though, because it started with, “Dave,\nyou have never really paid attention to this before. This time, watch, learn,\nand listen.” So I did and 20 minutes later I knew exactly what I was\ngoing to do and how I would implement it into my program. \nThe results have been unreal! I’ve done tons of mobility work and other “prehab” types\nof training and really got little from them. Some things did help but nowhere\nas much as the\n“band traction” stuff Dick showed me that day. \nIf you’ve seen his videos or heard him speak, none of this will be\nnew to you, but if not, I ask you to… \nWatch, Learn, and Listen. \nSo what are these called?\nI’ll name these movements as I refer to them. These are very simple\nnames I use that really have no special meaning. While these may seem like\ntraction, they really aren’t. I actually asked Dr. Ryan Smith to tell\nme exactly what these movements are. \nThis is what I was told: \n“As far as a name for the exercises, they are basically Band-Assisted\nDistraction w/ active joint ROM. If you just move the joint around\nan arc of movement without breaking it down into individual ROM, then I would\ncall it circumduction. So, that leaves us with Band-Assisted Shoulder\nDistraction w/ active circumduction.”\n\nOkay, Band Traction it is… \nHorizontal – Shoulder Traction with Bands \nBecause I’m using video to show these movements, the descriptions will\nbe very easy to write. Why write what video can show? With this movement\nyou’ll loop two bands together (the average bands work best for this\none) and place one end around the top of your power rack. \nThis video shows the band pegs we use on the EliteFTS rack. If you don’t\nhave this option, just slip knot it around the top of your rack. We use the\npegs to get a little more tension. \nNote: Make sure your rack is bolted down. \nOnce you get the bands set up, you’ll reach up under the band and then\ngrab the two ends together. This will place the band around the top of your\nwrist so it’ll pull through the arm without you having to grip the band. \nOnce you’ve “attached” the band, you’ll need to step\naway from the rack until you feel like your arm is being ripped off. When\nyou get in this position, move, move, and move more. Pull in every angle\nyou can think of. Pull with your elbow in, out, whatever. \nAs Dick likes to say, there’s no wrong way to move; just keep moving\nBUT make sure to get a full deep stretch at the end of each rep. Also, make\nsure to move your body. Do some movements facing the rack, and then some\nat a 1/2 turn, facing away from the rack, on your knees, anything! Just keep\nmoving. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical – Shoulder Traction with Bands \nThis is the same concept as the Horizontal Shoulder Traction except we now\nwill be working in a different plain. To perform this movement, toss a band\nover the top of a power rack (the light band works better for this one) so\nthe band is even on each side. \nReach up through the band so the band wraps around the back of your wrist.\nGrab the two ends of the band together so it doesn’t slip out of your\nhands. You may also want to kneel on the floor to get a better pull. Once\nyou’re in position, begin moving. \nPull your hands down with your elbows out and elbows in. There’s no\nwrong way to move; just keep moving and make sure to get a full stretch at\nthe top. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanding Lower Back Traction with Bands\nI’ve seen this movement do more for people than any other lower back “prehab” movement\nI’ve ever seen (with the exception of the Reverse Hyper Machine (link\nto http://www.flexcart.com/members/elitefts/default.asp?cid=157)\nTo set this up you’ll need to loop two strong bands together and attach\none end around the top of your power rack (make sure the rack is bolted down).\nAfter this is set up, slide your torso into the band so the band is resting\naround your upper back. \nNow you’ll need to step away from the rack so the band is pulling your\ntorso forward and up. When you get into postion, begin moving. Don’t\nlimit your movement to bending and arching. Step back into a reverse lunge,\nsquat, side bend, side lunge, torso twists, basically everything. Just keep\nmoving. \nAfter a minute or so, move the band down your back and do the same movements\nagain. There are hundreds of combination and band position you can do. Try\nas many as you can think up and you’ll notice a difference on how your\nback feels as soon as you’re done. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeck Traction with Bands \nFirst off, don’t be stupid with this one and break your neck. Use you\nhead and be smart. If it hurts don’t do it and keep the movements small\nand controlled. \nThere are several variations you can do with this one. The best bands to\nuse for this are the light bands. Begin with one light band looped over the\ntop of a power rack. Place the band behind the back of your head and move\nyour head around. After some time, move the band down to the lower part of\nyour head and neck and move some more. Work all four angles of your neck:\nfront, right side, rear, and left side. \nAfter you finish this, add a second band to the rack and place one band\nbehind your head and the other under your chin (not on your neck!). Grab\nthe bands so they don’t come apart and step away so you feel like your\nhead is about to be ripped off your torso. \nWhen in position, move, move and move more. If you feel like you can’t\nbreathe, STOP. I can’t believe I even have to write that but I’ve\nlearned over the years that people will do stupid things. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHip Traction with Bands\nThis is a great one to watch big and largely immobile people try to perform.\nI’m sure you’ll get a kick out of the video. This is one I was\nunable to do for a very long time because just getting on the floor was a\npain in the ass, let alone placing the band around my ankle. Now that I can\ndo this, though, I’ve noticed a big difference in how my hips and groin\nfeel. \nWith this movement, you can attach the band on the top of the rack, mid\nrack, or at the lower section of the rack. You’ll need to use either\na strong or average band to get a great pull through the hip. \nAttach the end of the band that’s not on the rack around your ankle.\nI find it best to loop it once around my ankle so it doesn’t slip off.\n Once you’re positioned, slide away from the rack so the band feels like\nit’s pulling your leg off. \nAs with all the other band traction movements, MOVE. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLying Lower Back Traction with Bands \nThis is one where the video will really help out. \nTo begin you’ll need one light band. Sit on the floor with your feet\nflat on the ground pulled close to your body. Wrap the band around your back\nand place one end of the band around each knee. \nAfter you get the band attached, lie flat on the floor with your knees pulled\nup toward your torso. Now, drop your knees from side to side. After you do\nthose, get on your hands and knees like your favorite porn star. \nFrom this position MOVE like your favorite porn star. \nMoan and groan if you like. I’m sure the people in the gym will love\nto see that. Let me warn you right now, though. If you try and have your\nwife or girl friend do this during the “act of love,” be forewarned\nthat the band can slip off her knees and thus sling your nutbag to the other\nside of the room. \nHave you ever tried to find a misplaced nutbag? \nLet me tell you, if you’re lucky enough to find it, it won’t be\npretty. I can assure you it’ll be flying at the speed of light. Have\nyou ever shot a water balloon with one of those big rubber bands? Now\nyou have a picture of what I’m talking about. Odds are it will bounce\noff the wall and find its way under the bed. \nWhen was the last time you looked under your bed? \nNow you’ll have to wash it to get all the dust mites off. Oh, you think\nthis is the end of the story. Not even close. When you wash it off, all the\nwrinkles will disappear, so now you’re faced with the dilemma of how\nto get the wrinkles back in the bag. \nYou can, A, wad it up like a spit ball or B, toss it in the washer. I wouldn’t\nsuggest the washer for one reason, though: how many socks have been lost\nin there?\nOkay, I think you see the point and consequences. Now let’s get back\non track. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus “Band” Movement — The Prisoner Pulldown\nOkay, this isn’t really a band movement, but I threw it in because\nthe bands made me think of it.\nTo do these, just attach ankle straps around your wrists and attach them\nto the hook at the top of the lat machine. This’ll take your grip entirely\nout of the motion and allow you to concentrate on the lats. Plus, it has\nthe added bonus of allowing you to focus more on pulling with the elbows.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image004-1.jpg\" width=\"395\" height=\"767\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image006-1.jpg\" width=\"395\" height=\"747\"/>\n\n\n\nSample Traction Plan \nThis is all great stuff but how can you use it? Here’s the plan I recommend:\nThis is to be performed before every training session. Each movement will\nlast 1-3 minutes. \n\nStanding Lower Back Traction \nHorizontal Shoulder Traction \nVertical Shoulder Traction \nNeck Traction \nHip Traction \nLying Lower Back Traction \n\n\nIn the Words of “The Band Man”\nThis article wouldn’t be complete without having some material from\nDick Hartzell. Dick is always on the road, working or with his family so\ngetting him to write is not an option. \nHe’s also so passionate about bands that there was no way I was going\nto scribble notes and try to capture his passion. So, I did what I normally\ndo. I picked up the phone and gave him a call:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere can these bands be bought? \nEliteFTS is the place to go for Jump Stretch Bands. \n http://www.flexcart.com/members/elitefts/default.asp?cid=138\nYou can phone us with your questions and orders at 888-854-8806 or log onto www.elitefts.com. \nWe also have an extensive Q and A packed full of great information from\nmany of the world’s best lifters, coaches and trainers.
