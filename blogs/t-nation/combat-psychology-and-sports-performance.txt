"“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.” — Mike Tyson\nPicture a large plastic zip tie, about an inch wide. The smaller\nversions are sometimes used to tie garbage bags; soldiers and\npolice officers use the large ones to restrain people. Anyone could\nfigure out how to thread a zip tie: You put the little end through\nthe hole and pull on it. \nIn 2001, psychologists from Yale and the U.S. Army imposed this\ntask as part of a scenario conducted in a study with a group of\nArmy Special Forces soldiers. During the scenario, the soldiers who\nhad not pre-threaded their flex cuffs in advance found themselves\nalmost incapable of using them. \nWhat went wrong? Surely this wasn’t an inept group of men.\nThey’re some of the toughest, most highly trained in the world; the\nreason for their failure couldn’t possibly be inability. \nSomething beyond physical skills comes into play.\n\nCome Out Fighting\nIf you’re a mixed martial artist, you’ll know how to do an\narmbar and a triangle choke. If you’re a football player, you know\nthat you can catch a football or tackle an opponent who dares to do\nsuch a thing in your area of the field. If you’re a climber, you\nknow how to pull gear off your harness with one hand, place it, and\nclip your rope into it. \nYou’ve done these things thousands of times, and know how to do\nthem well.\nYet numerous people have found themselves suddenly incapable of\ndoing something as simple as dialing 911. They forget the tiniest\ndetails, like the need to dial 9 for an outside line, or they\ninexplicably call 411 over and over. \nIn my first MMA fight in San Diego, I found myself repeatedly\nlocking my opponent into a guillotine choke, yet I was unable to\nfinish the choke and submit him. I lost the fight by a single point\nafter going into overtime. \nOnly afterwards did I realize that I’d been keeping my\nopponent’s arm inside the choke and leaving one side of his neck\nopen. It was a mistake that I’d probably made countless times in\ntraining, but had always had the presence of mind to correct. \nI could lock this choke out smoothly in a training environment,\nso why couldn’t I think well enough to do the same thing during the\nfight, in front of thousands of people? Why couldn’t the Special\nForces guys figure out how to thread their flex cuffs? How could a\nperson possibly forget how to dial 911? \n\nPerformance Degradation\nThe scenario being conducted by the Special Forces soldiers was\na close-quarters combat (CQC) simulation. It involved urban warfare\nwith their real weapons loaded with paint bullets, hand-to-hand\ncombat with role players wearing impact-reduction suits, an\noverwhelming noise stimulus, and poor, macabre lighting. \nAt random intervals throughout the scenario, the SF operators\nwould, without warning, receive a significant pain stimulus to the\nupper body via an electric shock in order to simulate a gunshot\nwound. \nUnder this level of stress, the warriors were incapable of\nperforming unrehearsed complex motor skills, such as threading\ntheir zip cuffs to subdue their adversaries. \nThe same performance degradation occurs with the person trying\nto dial 911, the climber who bumbles repeatedly while hanging from\nhis fingertips at the crux of a dangerous route, and a fighter who\nsuddenly realizes that what he knows in the gym is not what he\nknows in the ring. \nThe skills you possess in a calm, controlled environment will\nprobably not be the skills you possess when it really matters. The\nimpact of stress may mean the difference between victory and\ndefeat, a clean climb and a jarring fall, or even life and death. \nThe good news is that the effects of stress can, to some extent,\nbe controlled. \n\nYour Body Under Stress\n“Fear makes men forget, and skill that cannot fight is\nuseless.” — Brasidas of Sparta\nThe sympathetic nervous system mobilizes the body’s energy\nreserves during times of stress. It neutralizes processes\ncontrolled by the parasympathetic nervous system, such as\ndigestion, while ramping up secretion of adrenaline and\nnoradrenaline, dilating bronchial tubes in the lungs, tensing\nmuscles, and dilating heart vessels. \nIt also causes your heart rate to increase. \nThere’s a direct relation between stress-induced heart rate and\nboth mental and physical performance. Too low, such as when you’re\njust waking up, and you can’t think or react very quickly. Too\nhigh, and one’s ability to think and perform motor skills degrades. \nDave Grossman, a psychology professor at the U.S. Military\nAcademy at West Point, former Army Ranger, and author of the book On Killing, uses a color-coded graph to categorize the\neffects of heart rate on performance. \n\n\nHeart Rate (BPM)\nCondition \nEffects \n\n\n60-80\nWhite/Yellow\nNormal resting heart rate\n\n\n>115\n \nFine motor skill deteriorates\n\n\n115-145\nRed\nOptimal performance level for complex motor skills and visual and cognitive reaction time\n\n\n>145\n \nComplex motor skills deteriorate\n\n\n145-175\nGray\nBlack-level performance degradation may begin\n\n\n>175\nBlack\nCognitive processing deteriorates\nBlood vessels constrict\nLoss of peripheral vision\nLoss of depth perception\nLoss of near vision\nAuditory exclusion\n\n\nGrossman calls the earliest stages of this spectrum Condition\nWhite. The boundary between here and the next stage, Condition\nYellow, is more psychological than physiological.\nWe first see major physiological changes around 115 beats per\nminute. Between here and roughly 145 bpm is Condition Red, which is\nthe range in which the body’s complex motor skills and reaction\ntimes are at their peak. \nNext is Condition Gray, which is where major performance\ndegradations begin to show.\nAbove 175 bpm is Condition Black, which is marked by extreme\nloss of cognitive and complex motor performance, freezing, fight or\nflight behavior, and even loss of bowel and bladder control. Here,\ngross motor skills such as running and charging are at their\nhighest. \nRemember, these effects are the product of psychologically induced stress, not physical stress.\nAn increased heart rate doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re under\npsychological stress — you can run a few sets of wind sprints\nand get your heart rate around 200 beats per minute without\nforgetting how to use your cell phone. \nThese lines, however, aren’t drawn with permanent marker.\nIt’s possible to push the envelope of complex motor-skill\nperformance under stress right up to the edge of Condition Black.\nIt’s also possible to reach Condition Black for its gross\nmotor-skill performance benefits, such as sprinting or deadlifting,\nand then quickly recede to a calmer state to allow nervous system\nrecovery. \nThis generally occurs with specific, well-rehearsed skills. For\nexample, studies done on top Formula One drivers found that their\nheart rates averaged 175 bpm for hours on end. These drivers\nperform a limited set of finely tuned skills with extraordinary\nspeed, under a good deal of stress. \nLikewise, the top performers in the Special Forces study had\nmaximum heart rates of 175, while those who were slightly less\nproficient typically had max heart rates of 180 bpm. In both cases,\n175 is the maximal rate before high-level performance drops off. \nAt a certain point, an increased heart rate becomes\ncounterproductive because the heart can no longer take in a full\nload of blood, resulting in less oxygen delivered to the brain.\nThat, in theory, could be the cause of the performance decrease\nseen above 175 bpm. \n\nStress Inoculation\n“No man fears to do that which he knows he does well.”\n— Duke of Wellington\nAs defined by Dave Grossman in another of his books, On\nCombat, stress inoculation is a process by which prior success\nunder stressful conditions acclimatizes you to similar situations\nand promotes future success. \nIn a classic stress inoculation study, rats were divided into\nthree groups. The first group was taken directly from their cages,\ndropped into a tub of water, and observed with a timer. It took 60\nhours for all of them to drown. \nThe second group was taken out of their cages and held upside\ndown to create stress. After the rats gave up on kicking and\nsquirming and their nervous systems went into parasympathetic\nbacklash, they were placed in the tub of water. This group lasted\n20 minutes before drowning. \nThe last group was given the same upside-down stress treatment,\nand then placed back into their cages to recuperate. This was\nrepeated several times until the rats became accustomed to the\nstressor. Finally, the rats were taken out, given the stress\ntreatment and placed immediately in the water. They swam. For 60\nhours. \nThe repeated bouts of stress allowed the rats to become\ninoculated against the stressor. Even with an event that had cut\nthe lifespan of the previous group down to 20 minutes, the third\ngroup was able to perform at the same level as the group that faced\nno stress at all. \n\nImmunizing Your System\nThere are many forms of stress inoculation, and to be most\neffective, they must be precisely geared toward one’s chosen\nactivity. Fighters inoculate themselves by simulating a fight\nthrough sparring. Firefighters are inoculated against fire by being\nexposed to it repeatedly. Skydivers eventually develop a high level\nof familiarity and comfort with great heights. \nAs a member of a U.S. military Special Operations force, I know\nthat we wanted our training to be as realistic as possible.\nMilitary training has improved steadily since WWI, moving toward\nincreasingly realistic targets. The closer the training scenario\nresembles the real thing, the greater the performance carryover\nwill be. \nThis is called simulator fidelity: Switching from simple\nbull’s-eye targets to silhouettes and then to 3D pop-ups was\none such evolution, but we would take this a step further. \nThe first time I jammed a magazine loaded with blue paint\nbullets into my assault rifle, dove out of an ambushed car, and\nfired them at a living person while sprinting for cover, it scared\nthe hell out of me. I had such tunnel vision that I could barely\nsee the person I was shooting at, let alone aim. After several\nrepetitions, however, I was able to stabilize myself, turn toward\nthe oncoming fire, and hit my target. \nDespite the necessary specificity, there’s still a general\ncarryover. Adapting yourself to a stressful situation seems to\ncreate a sort of “stress immune system,” which allows greater\ntolerance and more rapid adaptation to other stressful situations. \nIn On Combat, Grossman cites an example of a full-contact\nfighter who joined his team for CQC weapons training in a kill\nhouse. During the first engagement, the fighter’s heart rate shot\nto 200 bpm, and he dropped his weapon. However, his background in\nfacing other stressful situations allowed him to adapt relatively\nquickly. By the end of the day, he was performing superbly. \n\nLearning a Motor Skill\nThe field of neuroscience has a variety of theories on how\nlearning occurs and exactly how the brain functions to create a\nconscious, intelligent human. \nJeff Hawkins, author of On Intelligence and inventor of\nthe Palm Pilot, has developed a theory that the brain is not a\ncomputer (a commonly attempted analogy), but in fact a system that\nstores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the\nworld. \nThe brain remembers sequences of events and their nested\nrelationships, and then makes predictions based on those memories. \nThese memories are stored in the neocortex, a\ntwo-millimeter-thick sheath that coats your brain. Its 30 billion\nnerve cells contain all your skills, knowledge, and life\nexperiences. (Fun fact: For all the similarities in brain structure\nacross the animal kingdom, mammals are the only ones with a\nneocortex. Suck that, reptiles!)\nNow let’s talk about how you learn and remember motor patterns,\nso you can understand what’s happening when someone throws a ball\nat your head and you grab it without having to perform physics\ncalculations to figure out that it’s on a collision course with\nyour teeth. \nThe neocortex is divided into six layers that function in a\nhierarchy. Each layer attempts to store and recall sequences, with\nhigher layers having the ability to put together more comprehensive\nsequences or concepts than lower layers. \nFor instance, say you’re grappling in a jiu jitsu match. You see\nan opening, and “triangle choke” flashes through the upper level of\nyour neocortex. This command is passed down to the next layer,\nwhich breaks the concept down into the further sequences: “Drag one\narm, throw leg over neck, shift hips.”\nAt the next layer in your cortex, these commands are broken down\nfurther: “Tighten fingers around opponent’s wrist, and pull in such\na way as to prevent him from posturing up and\nescaping.”\nNow let’s say that your opponent pulls out of the triangle\nchoke. The predicted sequence being performed is supposed to end\nwith your opponent being choked and submitted, but it doesn’t match\nthe reality. So the new sensory data is passed back up the\nhierarchy until a suitable sequence is found and passed back down\nagain. \n\nToo Much Information\nIf you’ve ever taught someone a movement in the weight room,\nyou’ve probably been frustrated by the process. Teaching someone a\nkettlebell swing involves a number of cues which, for an\nexperienced lifter, are ingrained so well and so low in the cortex\nthat they can be carried out without conscious thought. \nNot so with the newbie, whose upper neocortex is at full tilt\nprocessing and associating commands like “keep your heels on the\nground,” “neutral spine,” and “fire your\nglutes.” This is often when you’ll hear the trainee say things\nlike, “There’s so much to remember at once.” \nWithin the newbie cortex, the uppermost level is occupied just\ntrying to ingrain one of those completely foreign commands. This\ndoesn’t leave room for much else, since the higher a pattern must\ngo to be recognized, the more regions of the cortex must become\ninvolved. The sensory feedback in response to those actions is\ncompletely novel, so the patterns from something as simple as\nputting one’s heels on the ground create countless new\nassociations. \nAfter a while, the cortex will be able to associate a variety of\nnew sensations with expected forms of feedback. Now, when the\ntrainee hears the command, his cortex will be able to predict what\nit will feel like to carry it out.\nThe command can now be relegated to a lower level of the\nhierarchy, freeing the upper levels to process other commands. The\nmore associations brought on by repetitions of a movement, the\nlower in the cortical hierarchy the pattern can be\nrelegated.\nThink of the first time you ever rode a bicycle. It took all of\nyour conscious energy. But after countless repetitions under\nvarying conditions, you can do it while talking to your buddy about\nthe worlds dirtiest strip club (it’s in Mexico, in case you’re\nwondering) — even if something unexpected comes up, like\ngrandma walking in front of your bicycle. \nThis is why repetitions are so crucial in learning a motor\nskill. More repetitions equal more associations and a more strongly\ningrained motor pattern. \n\nQuality Matters\nWe know that repetitions create auto-associative memories within\nthe cerebral cortex, which in turn dictate behavior. This process\nhappens for everything, from shooting a basketball to lifting a\nbarbell to throwing a punch. \nSince you’re ingraining a pattern with each repetition, it’s\ncrucial that any sort of technique be drilled flawlessly. Even in a\ncontrolled environment, with a punching bag for an opponent, poor\ntechnique in training will be reproduced when it matters. You\ncan’t train sloppy and then expect to perform\nwell.\nEven if two different motor patterns are ingrained, the act of\ndeciding between the two and discarding the poor one will slow\nreaction time and performance. A study conducted in 1952 by W.E.\nHicks found that increasing the range of potential responses from\none to two slowed down reaction time by 58%. \nThis is why running backs are taught to cover and protect the\nfootball at all times, even when they’re just practicing and\nnobody’s trying to strip it away. For the same reason, a shooter in\nthe military or law enforcement will never place his finger on the\ntrigger of his weapon until he’s made the decision to fire. \nWhen the trained motor pattern is relegated to subconscious\nthought, there can be no question that it will be carried out\ncorrectly.\n\nNavigating a New World\nSo let’s say you’ve been training, practicing, and grooving\nthe necessary motor patterns for your sport or profession. You’re\nready, and you step into the ring, onto the field, or into the kill\nhouse. \nYou’ve just entered a new world.\nThe patterns ingrained in your cortex will be largely\nunassociated with this new, stressful environment, unless it’s been\nsimulated using stress inoculation. \nThe higher stress levels and the overwhelming sensory feedback\nfrom the ongoing situation are going to occupy the highest regions\nof your cerebral cortex. Your only available motor patterns will be\nthose that have been relegated lower in the hierarchy. If you’ve\njust learned a new skill, now would not be the time to\nrely on it. \nComplex motor control is going to diminish as your heart rate\nincreases; the exact heart rate at which this happens will depend\non your level of fitness and the degree to which you’re inoculated\nagainst stress. \nAs motor control drops off, the first patterns you’ll lose are\nthose that haven’t been strongly ingrained low in the hierarchy.\nThis applies to the ones with the most variations, the ones\nyou’ve rehearsed with the fewest repetitions, or those\nyou’ve learned in environments that least resemble this one. \nDuring my first MMA fight, my immediately available motor\npatterns were only the simplest: punch, kick, charge, clinch. Even\nsomething as elementary as a guillotine choke took on sudden\ncomplexity. In my adrenaline-fueled state of mind, I kept making\nthe same mistake as hard and fast as I could. \nThe same thing occurred with the Special Forces soldiers who\nfound themselves clumsily trying to jam a zip cuff together. The\npattern hadn’t been rehearsed well enough to be recallable under\nhigh stress, and was temporarily lost. \nThose who wanted to dial 911 and found themselves listening to a\n411 message over and over again were repeating the pattern of keys\nmost heavily ingrained. Their cortex knew they had to dial a\nthree-digit number and went with what it could immediately recall. \nThe 911 pattern hadn’t been ingrained through physical\nrepetition. This is why it’s actually a good idea to have your\nfamily members practice this. (Just remember to disconnect the\nphone first.)\n\nThe 16-Second Solution\nThere are three basic ways to combat the effects of stress on\nphysical performance: \n• Stress inoculation\n• Quality motor-skill repetition in an environment of high\nsimulator fidelity\n• Biofeedback \nI’ve already discussed the first two, which brings me to\nbiofeedback, the process of consciously regulating the body’s\nnormally subconscious functions. \nIn On Combat, Grossman teaches a technique called\ntactical breathing. \nNext time you’re under stress and feel your heart rate picking\nup uncontrollably, take four full seconds to draw a deep breath.\nHold that breath for four seconds, and then exhale for the next\nfour seconds. Pause for another four seconds before repeating the\nentire 16-second sequence at least three times. \nThis practice will immediately slow your heart rate and bring\nyour stress response under control. You’ll feel mental clarity and\nmanual dexterity return, and it’ll be easier to recall previously\ningrained motor skills. \n\nUsing Condition Black to Your Advantage \nGross motor skills like sprinting, charging, and picking up\nreally heavy stuff are at their peak in Condition Black, as\nI’ve mentioned. That’s why you see powerlifters slapping\neach other, yelling, and generally making a ruckus before a big\nlift. It’s intentional nervous system arousal. \nAccording to a study coauthored by Grossman, these performance\nbenefits peak within 10 seconds. That is, if you need to perform\nyour task within 10 seconds of reaching Condition Black, with your\nheart rate exceeding 175 bpm, you’ll get 100 percent of the\nbenefits. But after 30 seconds you get just 55%. It’s down to\n35% after 60 seconds, and 31% after 90 seconds. It takes a minimum\nof three minutes of rest for the nervous system to fully recover\nfrom this ordeal. \nPrior to a big lift, you can maximize your gross motor skills by\nartificially inducing stress and creating sympathetic nervous\nsystem arousal. For the greatest benefit, you’ll have to time it\nwell so that you take your position on the bar right around the\n10-second mark. \nAfterwards, in order to prevent subsequent drops in\nnervous-system arousal, allow for at least three minutes of rest.\nThis is where tactical breathing can come in handy, as it can bring\nyour arousal levels back to normal and speed recovery. \n\nWrapping Up: Preparation Is Power\nSun Tzu wrote, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you\nneed not fear the result of a hundred battles.”\nIn this case, the enemy is stress, which, as you now know, comes\nin a variety of flavors. You’ll enjoy peak performance in\ncomplex motor skills and reaction time at Condition Red, when your\nheart rate is between 115 and 145 bpm. But even then, your fine\nmotor skills are starting to diminish, meaning that you might\nstruggle to tie your shoe even though you’re at the top of\nyour game.\nAs your heart rate rises above 145 bpm, you might see a real\ndrop in your ability to do the things you can do perfectly well in\npractice and other less stressful situations. And when you get past\n175 bpm, you might not be able to do anything precisely the way\nyou’ve been trained to do it.\nBut even then, in Condition Black, you could hit a personal\nrecord in the bench press or deadlift, as long as you start the\nlift within 10 seconds of reaching that state of nervous-system\narousal.\nAnd you can mitigate the negative effects of all these states of\nstressful agitation by practicing your skills and your craft within\nthe parameters in which they’ll be most difficult to perform.\nThat’s why coaches whose teams are about to play in\nnotoriously hostile arenas will try to simulate that environment in\npractice by bringing in noise machines or deliberately throwing\ndistractions at their players. And it’s why elite military\nunits go as far as they can to simulate battle zones before the\nsoldiers are forced to perform their duties inside a real\none.\nBut, as Sun Tzu wrote, it’s not enough to understand the\nconditions in which you’ll have to perform. You have to\nunderstand how you react to those conditions. That takes more than\npractice. It takes the right kind of practice. \nThe reward? When you perfect your game under properly simulated\nconditions, you’ll be invincible."
