"Here’s what you need to know…\n\nPyramids involve picking a number of reps and working down from there on each subsequent set.\nThere are different pyramids with different rep ranges for strength, generalized hypertrophy, and bodybuilding combos or supersets.\n\nAt my gym, we do a variety of what we call “pyramids” for fat loss, strength, and hypertrophy. Pyramids are very simple and effective, and when you combine exercises – bench, squat, and deadlift – they become even more effective.\nWhat’s a Pyramid?\nA pyramid is super simple. You take an exercise, pick a start number of reps, and begin your pyramid. Let’s use squats as an example.\n\nDo 10 reps\nRest\nDo 9 reps\nRest\nDo 8 reps\nRepeat this pattern until you hit your final pyramid number, which could be 8 reps, 5 reps, or 1 rep, depending on whether you’re doing pyramids for fat loss, strength, or hypertrophy.\n\nPyramid Benefits\n\nYou use the same weight for all your sets.\nAs you fatigue, the number of reps lower.\nMentally it’s easy to focus and maintain motivation as your rep numbers get lower with each set.\nPyramids can be used for conditioning, fat loss, strength, or hypertrophy.\nThere are unlimited combinations of exercises, rep schemes, and rest protocols.\n\nStrength Pyramids\nWhen it comes to building strength, the magic number for me and a lot of lifters has always been 5 reps. Anything more than 5 is too many, and doing singles over time isn’t a good thing because it leads to CNS fatigue, injuries, and overall wear and tear on the body. As such, when I’m doing pyramids for strength, my starting number is 5 reps.\nSo let’s say we’re doing deadlifts and the starting weight is 465 pounds.\n\nDo 5 reps at 465 pounds.\nRest between 2 and 5 minutes.\nDo 4 reps at 465 pounds.\nRest between 2 and 5 minutes.\nDo 3 reps at 465 pounds.\nContinue in this manner until you finish up with 465 for 1 rep. The following week, increase the weight by 5 to 10 pounds and repeat the strength pyramid.\n\nYou end up doing 15 reps overall using the same weight. You’re doing the same work as you would with 3 sets of 5 or 5 sets of 3, but the great thing is that every rep is high quality. You stay focused and you keep the bar moving fast and true because you use fewer reps with each set. As a competitive powerlifter, pyramids are perfect for me as I get in 5 sets of every lift, but I’m also working in all rep ranges from 5 right down to a tight 1-rep max at the end.\nHere’s a sample strength pyramid workout for powerlifting:\nDay 1\nA. Back Squat\n\nSet 1: 5 Reps\nSet 2: 4 Reps\nSet 3: 3 Reps\nSet 4: 2 Reps\nSet 5: 1 Reps\n\nB. Bench Press\n\nSet 1: 5 Reps\nSet 2: 4 Reps\nSet 3: 3 Reps\nSet 4: 2 Reps\nSet 5: 1 Reps\n\nC. Deadlift\n\nSet 1: 5 Reps\nSet 2: 4 Reps\nSet 3: 3 Reps\nSet 4: 2 Reps\nSet 5: 1 Reps\n\nAdd 5 pounds to the bar the following week. Do this for 4-6 weeks and then change your program.\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Flat-Bench-Press.jpeg\" alt=\"Flat-Bench-Press\" />\n\nBasic Hypertrophy Pyramid\nThe magic number for building muscle falls between 5-12 reps. Of course, with squats the magic number can be 20 or more, but for now let’s stick with the conventional hypertrophy rep-range which is generally 8-12. As such, you’d begin the pyramid with 12 reps and finish with 8.\nSo let’s say we’re doing bench presses and the starting weight is 350 pounds.\n\nDo 12 reps at 250 pounds.\nRest about a minute.\nDo 11 reps at 250 pounds.\nRest about a minute.\nDo 10 reps at 250 pounds.\nContinue in this manner until you finish up with 250 for 8 reps.\n\nThe following week, increase the weight by 5 to 10 pounds and repeat the basic hypertrophy pyramid. You’d be doing 5 sets for a total of 50 reps.\nBodybuilding Hypertrophy Pyramid\nWhen it comes to building muscle, I find it best to train opposing muscle groups together. Chest and back is a great combo, as are biceps and triceps and hamstrings and quads. This is nothing new when it comes to bodybuilding. However, when you combine a pyramid into training opposing muscle groups, things get to be a lot more fun and the benefits are amazing for blood flow, pump, recovery, and of course, building muscle.\nLet’s look at training chest and back together and we’ll use bench presses and bent-over rows as examples. Your first set on bench press is 12 reps. You rest for 1 minute and your next set is 12 reps on bent-over rows. Rest another minute and do 11 reps of bench presses. Rest again and do 11 reps on bent-over rows. Continue super-setting in this manner until you finish sets of 8 on both exercises.\nPairing opposing muscle groups like this will allow for more recovery between sets and give you a pump that’s beyond intense. Do this with your training partner in a “you go, I go” workout and things can get crazy.
