"I like to hurt.\nLet me clarify that. I don’t like hurting people, I like to feel pain after a set.\nCall is psychological; hell, call it pathological.\nFor whatever reason, feeling an intense burn or cramping in my muscles is the residue of hard work. It’s like a badge of honor that stands in stark contrast to the guys on either side of me in the gym who casually do their single set of 8 or 10 reps without so much as breaking a grimace or spouting a bead of sweat.\nWuss boys.\nAs such, I love throwing the occasional extended set into my workout. For the uninitiated, extended sets are sets where you continue to do more work once you’ve reached failure in whatever movement you’re doing at the time.\nThere are several ways to do this:\n\nYou can reduce the amount of weight and keep pumping (the conventional drop set).\nYou can do half or quarter reps at the end of a regular set (post-fatigue partials).\nYou can hold the weight in place in the contracted position for as long as you can at the end of a set (post-fatigue isometrics).\nYou can reduce the amount of weight and continue repping out (drop sets).\nTaking a very short rest and continuing the set with the same weight (rest-pause).\n\nTrouble is, those methods are BORING, at least to me.\nI prefer two other methods that I think are more stimulating, mentally AND physically:\nThey’re called Mechanical Drop Sets and Post-Fatigue Tri sets.\nMechanical Drop Sets\nInvolve doing more reps once you hit failure, only rather than reducing the weight, you simply make small adjustments in the execution of the movement that allow you to keep on going.\nAs an example, in the following triad of biceps exercises: Reverse grip curls, “regular” grip curls, and hammer curls, the reverse grip ones are the hardest, followed in relative ease of execution by “regular” grip curls and then hammer curls.\nIf you rep out doing reverse curls, you’ll be able to continue doing more reps by simply rotating your wrists and doing conventional curls. When you rep out using conventional curls, you should be able to eke out a few more reps by rotating your wrists and doing hammer-grip curls.\nEasy but oh-so hard.\nPost-Fatigue Tri Sets\nInvolve doing a second and a third exercise for the same muscle or muscle group without taking any rest. Again, easy but oh-so hard.\nThe science behind them is simply this: the more muscle fibers you can exhaust, the more muscle you can grow.\nThe potential drawback? You can easily do too much work and compromise recovery. Of course, that won’t be a problem if you use them judiciously; I’d say no more than three or four sets of an extended set exercise per body part.\nWhether you want to regularly incorporate them into your workouts, or occasionally use one to punish your miserable self for sins against man, nature, or God, here are some of my favorites.\nI appropriated many from Christian Thibaudeau, some from Charles Poliquin, and one from Dr. Clay Hyght. I dreamed up the others during lonely evenings spent in my backyard gym.\nRemember, move from variation to variation within the set without taking any rest, but rest about 2 minutes in-between sets.\nShoulders\nMechanical Drop Set 1\n\nStanding Military press: (no leg drive) 8-10 reps\nPush press: (use a little leg drive) same weight;
