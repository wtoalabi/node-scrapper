"I hate to start off the week on a sour note, but you’re lookin’\na little small.\nNow, before you trade in your gym membership for Tuesday night\nknitting with Betty, try these sweet and simple exercises to fill\nout your frame.\nSome are new and others not-so-new (try over 100 years old), but\nthe more tools you have in your toolbox, the more ways you have to\nget the job done.\nThe Posterior Chain Blaster (AKA The Gunthar Row)\nThis first exercise works the whole posterior chain hard.\nThe hamstrings, lower back, glutes, and upper back all receive a\npowerful stimulation. As the saying goes, “An athlete is only as\nstrong as the back of his body.” So, this movement is extremely\neffective at improving athletic performance, posture, and strength\nin movements such as the deadlift and the Olympic lifts.\nHell, it used to be a staple in the training of the former shot\nput world record holder, Werner Gunthar, who could power clean over\n450 pounds as if the bar was empty and jump hurdles like an\nantelope!\nBasically, the movement consists of performing a back extension,\nand at the top of the movement, rowing a barbell or dumbbells. \nAs you can see, Gunthar was kinda short on material. Nowadays,\nwe have solid back extension benches, so you won’t have to have\nMario hold down your ankles (apologies to his former coach,\nJan-Pierre Egger)!\nWhile a barbell can still be used, I do prefer to use\ndumbbells.\nYou can even perform the movement unilaterally to work on trunk\nstabilization at the same time. In which case, the key point is to\navoid trunk rotation at all costs.\nThis exercise is best performed for higher reps, anywhere\nbetween 8 and 20 is adequate, although I generally recommend\nsticking to the 8 to 12 rep range.\nOld-School Floor Pullover Press\nThis muscle builder of yesteryear was once seen building up\nphysiques from the early 1900s all the way to the ’60s. However,\nthey started doing it on a bench instead of the floor around the\n’50s.\nPersonally, I much prefer the floor version, as it’s both safer\nand more effective. I’ve seen a ton of shoulder injuries caused by\nstretching excessively at the bottom portion of a pullover, but\nsince the floor version doesn’t allow for that type of range of\nmotion, it’s pretty much risk-free.\nThe exercise is performed in two steps: First comes the pullover\nphase, followed by the close-grip pressing phase.\nPullover phase: Start with the barbell on the floor, over your\nhead, with your elbows bent at around 110 to 135 degrees. The\nelbows should be close and pointing toward the ceiling.\nWithout changing the elbow angle, lift the barbell off the\nfloor, and in a circular manner, bring your elbows to your sides\nuntil they touch the floor.\nAt the end of the pullover phase, you’re basically in the\nstarting position of a floor close-grip bench press.\nPressing phase: Picking up where the pullover phase left off,\nyour elbows should be on the floor, tucked in close to your body.\nPause on the floor for one or two seconds, and then press the\nweight up as in a close-grip bench press.\nOnce you reach the top of the pressing position (arms straight),\nre-bend your elbows slightly and lower the barbell back to the\nstarting position of the pullover phase (bar on the floor, above\nyour head).\nThis will give your lats, triceps, and chest an old-school\nbeating. It’s also a good movement for shoulder health, making it a\nrather complete and interesting exercise to use.\nSets of 12 to 15 reps are best; although some more experienced\nlifters will fare better doing sets of 8 to 12. Don’t go lower than\n8 reps, though!\nTsuki Dumbbell Press\nThese next two exercises – the Tsuki dumbbell press and\nthe Tsuki incline dumbbell press – are great assistance\nexercises for chest growth, as the internal rotation component of\nthe movement increases pectoral activation.\nAs such, I often prefer to use a variation of the Tsuki press\ninstead of a fly as the last pectoral exercise in a session. It’s\njust as good at focusing on the chest, but since you can load it a\nbit more, it’s all the more effective, especially as a change of\npace.\nThese movements are performed by taking a supinated grip in the\nstarting position and holding the dumbbells along the low pec line.\nThis will give you a greater pectoral stretch, and a stretched\nmuscle is a recruited muscle.\nPress the dumbbells while rotating them so that at the\ncompletion of the press you’re using a pronated grip.\nSets in the 6 to 8 or 8 to 12 rep ranges are the norm.\nCobra Lat Pull-Down\nAs we just saw, when you stretch a muscle you increase its\nactivation potential. So, this exercise is a very good one for\nthose who have problems activating and stimulating the lats.\nLie down sideways on an incline bench (around 45 degrees). Grab\na single handle attached to a high pulley, making sure that you\nfully stretch the lat at the top of the movement. Now, pull the\nweight so that your elbow is moving toward your hip area. Squeeze\nthe peak contraction and return to the stretched position.\nThis is a perfect finisher for the lats, so add sets of 10 to 12\nslow and controlled reps to the end of your back workout.\nProgress Renewed\nThankfully, with these new ways to torture yourself, that\nknitting class will be one member short.\nNow, get your ass to the gym and make the best use of these\ntools to unlock some new growth in those stubborn muscle groups of\nyours."
