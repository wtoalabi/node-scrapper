"In the first and second parts of this three-phase program, I outlined the exact workouts I use for the Strength Phase and the Volume Phase. Now let’s look at the next 10-day phase: Intensity. Or as I like to call it, insanity.\nIn my program, the word intensity means supersets, drop sets, rest/pause, tempo manipulation, partial reps, forced reps, and working to failure – all the things that bring as much blood as possible to the muscle and make it burn. The bigger the pump, the better! It’s funny, but I used to hate the pump. I wondered why I should bother with such little weights, but let’s just say I’ve learned a lot since then.\nIt might look a little crazy, but remember that you only have to do this workout one week out of every three. However, each time you do it, it’ll shock the body into a new level of growth.\nPhase 3 – Intensity\nDay 1  Legs, Posterior Chain\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nBody Weight Hyperextension\n3\n25\n\n\nB\nLying Hamstring Curl\n3\n40\n\n\n\n3 triple drop sets.
