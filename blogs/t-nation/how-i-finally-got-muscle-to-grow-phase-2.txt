"If you want to stop spinning your wheels and finally build some muscle, and I mean a lot of muscle, you need to use two training methods: heavy strength training to build muscle density and hardness, and hypertrophy methods that focus on rep volume and intensity techniques.\nIn the first part of this three-phase program, I outlined the exact workouts I use for the Strength phase. Now let’s look at the next 10-day phase: Volume.\nVolume\nTo get big, not just strong, you need volume in your training in addition to strength and power exercises. There’s going to be a lot of exercise variety with any high-volume training program, and variety is good! Every time I’ve introduced something new to my training that my body isn’t used to, it’s had a positive effect on muscle growth and strength.\nHowever, variety doesn’t mean “cram as many goofy exercises into one training program as you can.” You need a strategic plan. You have to apply volume and variety intelligently, in its own phase.\nHere’s how you do it:\nPhase 2 – Volume\nDay 1 – Quads, Hams, Posterior Chain\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nLying Hamstring Curl – After the fifth set, keep doing additional sets until you can’t do 10 reps\n5\n25, 20, 15, 12, 10\n\n\nB\nDeadlift\n3\n12\n\n\nC\nBarbell Lunge (wide stance)\n3\n12-15\n\n\nD1\nStanding Hamstring Curl\n3\n12-15\n\n\nD2\nStiff-Leg Deadlift\n3\n12-15\n\n\nE\nSeated Hamstring Curl\n2\n20\n\n\nF\nLeg Extension\n4\n20, 15, 12, 12\n\n\nG\nWide Stance Leg Press\n4\n25, 20, 15, 12\n\n\nH\nPendulum Squat/Hack Squat\n3\n12-15\n\n\nDay 2 – Chest, Triceps\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nIncline Barbell or Dumbbell Press\n4\n15, 13, 11, 10\n\n\nB\nLow Incline Dumbbell Flye\n3\n12-15\n\n\nC\nFlat Dumbbell Press\n3\n12-15\n\n\nD\nMachine Flye\n3\n12-15\n\n\nE\nHammer Strength Press (Decline)\n2\n12-15\n\n\nF\nMachine Dip\n3\n12-15\n\n\nG\nCable Straight Bar Pushdown\n3\n12-15\n\n\nH\nStraight Bar Overhead Extension\n3\n12-15\n\n\nI\nClose Grip Bench Push-up\n2\nfailure\n\n\nDay 3 – OFF\n \n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/amit-back.jpg\" alt=\"Amit Back\" />\n\nDay 4 – Back, Biceps\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nNeutral Chin-Up\n4\n12-15\n\n\nB\nWide Grip Pulldown\n3\n12-15\n\n\nC\nLow Row, Cable or Hammer\n3\n12-15\n\n\nD\nOne-Arm Reverse Pulldown\n2\n12-15\n\n\nE\nHigh Row Hammer\n2\n12-15\n\n\nF\nStanding EZ Bar Curl – 2 sets close, 2 sets wide\n4\n12-15\n\n\nG\nPreacher Machine Curl\n3\n12-15\n\n\nH1\nConcentration Dumbbell Hammer Curl\n2\n12-15\n\n\nH2\nPreacher One-Arm Machine\n2\n12-15\n\n\nDay 5 – Shoulders\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nReverse Pec Dec\n3\n15-20\n\n\nB\nStanding Lateral Machine\n3\n12-15\n\n\nC\nSeated Hammer Press\n4\n15, 12, 11, 10\n\n\nD\nDumbbell Front Raise\n3\n12-15\n\n\nE\nSeated Lateral Machine\n2\n15-20\n\n\nDay 6 – OFF\nDay 7 – Quads, Hams (Quad emphasis)\n\n\n \nExercise\nSets\nReps\n\n\nA\nLeg Extension\n5\n25, 20, 15, 12, 12\n\n\nB\nPendulum Squat/Hack Squat\n4\n12-15\n\n\nC\nNarrow Barbell Lunges (Smith)\n4\n12-15\n\n\nD\nFront Squat\n2-3\n20-25\n\n\nE\nHamstring Circuit – Pick 3 different hamstring curl machines and perform a circuit.

The volume is crazy, so expect a skin-tearing pump. You can also expect to be thoroughly exhausted after each workout. And if you find yourself dreading the never-ending nature of these workouts, don’t think things are going to get any easier. The insanity of Phase 3 is yet to come."
