Enter the barre, HIIT combo workout which combines basic barre moves with high intensity interval training to strengthen and tone while increasing your metabolism and endurance. The super-efficient HIIT method of training is the ideal workout for a quick burn and barre is incredibly effective for transforming the so-called ‘problem areas’ for women.

  Whether you want to squeeze in a workout during your lunch break or tone up for a fast-approaching event, this 6-exercise circuit workout has you covered. Each exercise requires total body engagement, but the workout is designed to emphasize the burn in the lower body.
