"Hands down—or legs down in this case—lunges are the best leg exercise around. A basic stationary lunge strengthens every leg muscle and targets the glutes like no other exercise can. If you want lean, strong legs, our 28-Day Lunge-A-Palooza Challenge is the perfect opportunity for you to get them. If you want to improve your running or biking, this is the challenge for you. If you don’t want a droopy behind—yup, this is your prevention. Even if you’re just looking for a way to burn a bunch of calories in a short amount of time, this is for you!
    
  Complaints about performing lunges are not in short supply. Part of the issue is obvious—they’re hard! They use the largest muscles in your body, so your heart rate goes up while your legs are burning. Not a comfortable situation. The other complaint usually has to do with sore or achy knees. Often, this stems from poor form. Poor form wreaks havoc on your knees and when your knees hurt, lunges don’t feel good. To avoid these unnecessary aches and pains, review our article on How To A Proper Lunge and take a peak at the picture below. Your front knee should track over the top of your foot, and you should keep your chest lifted, your chin up, and you core engaged.
  
  How To Do The Challenge
  Each day for 28 days, you will do five different lunge variations. Review the lunges listed below to learn the proper form and technique! The 28-Day Lunge-A-Palooza Challenge chart that you can print off tells you how many reps to do of all five lunge types each day. The reps and number of sets will vary from day-to-day, slowly increasing until day 28 when you will perform 100 lunges for beginners or 200 lunges for advanced! You will not only have a great sense of accomplishment, but amazing, strong and lean legs to show for it!
  PS: If your knees do get sore during the challenge, do a few less reps, skip a day in between and listen to your body. Oh yeah, and don’t forget that 3 reps would be 3 lunges so right, left, right. But if you are type A 🙂 and feel lop-sided (LOL) then do 4. The next day start on the left foot if you’d like…there aren’t any “lunge police” so it’s all the honor system. Have fun!
