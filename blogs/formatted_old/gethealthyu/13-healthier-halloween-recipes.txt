  McDonald’s may offer a tempting toy with its Happy Meal fries, but we can guarantee they don’t offer cute pumpkin shapes and a big dose of immune boosting beta-carotene thanks to the sweet potato!
  2. Candy Corn Popsicles

  Itty-bitty candy corn contains a not so itty-bitty list of questionable ingredients. Corn syrup, dextrose, yellow 6, and artificial flavoring just to name a few. These cute candy corn popsicles on the other hand? Yogurt, orange juice, and pineapple juice!
  3. Halloween Stuffed Peppers

  Be the cool parent and make these pumpkin peppers for a pre-trick or treating dinner. Your kids may actually eat their veggies when a frightful, but festive face is staring them down!
  4. Banana Ghost Pops
  
  Simple, scary, and scrumptious, these simple banana ghost pops are so simple to make. Simply freeze halved banana with a popsicle stick until solid (4+ hours or overnight), dunk in vanilla yogurt (or melted white chocolate if you want to be extra decadent), place mini chocolate chips in the eyes and re-freeze. Boo!
  5. Healthy Witch Fingers
