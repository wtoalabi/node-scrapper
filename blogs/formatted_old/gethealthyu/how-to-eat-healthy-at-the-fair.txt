"It’s easy to go overboard at the State Fair (or any carnival, fair or festival for that matter), thanks to the wide array of tempting and fattening foods everywhere you turn. But with strategic splurging, it’s possible to enjoy yourself without deprivation. It may seem impossible to eat healthy at the State Fair but you may be surprised to see lots of fruit and veggie vendors throughout the grounds. And going to the fair is not an everyday occurrence, so have some deep fried candy bar if you’ve been craving it all year! As long as you make smart choices, you’ll do minimal damage.
  In general, you’ll want to:
  1) Share with others. Since there are so many tempting options, think about having a little bit of several different things to keep from feeling deprived.
  2) Don’t graze. As you walk around, it can be easy to lose track of how much you’ve eaten if you’re picking up a treat at every stop. Check out the food options as you’re walking, make your selections and then sit and eat. That way you’ll be more conscious of what’s gone into your mouth.
  3) Consider setting limits. Pick one item you’ve got to have and let yourself enjoy it. Love a Bloomin’ Onion? Get one but definitely split it! Then, consider choosing healthier options the rest of the day.
  4) Look for healthy options. After you’ve had your major splurge (funnel cake, anyone?), seek out those fruit and veggie vendors we mentioned. We’re serious…they really do exist among the cheese curds and bucket of chocolate chip cookies! Think watermelon slices, grilled corn on the cob (hold the butter), and fruit kabobs. Craving a sweet drink? Fresh squeezed lemonade is your healthiest bet. At least water, lemon juice, and real sugar don’t contain artificial ingredients!
