"You’ve heard it before, an apple a day keeps the doctor away. But how about an avocado? The health benefits of avocados are truly impressive; avocados contain more potassium than a banana, are a good source of healthy fats, are low in sugar, contain all sorts of vitamins and minerals and so much more. So how do you include this super fruit into your diet on the daily? You can’t go wrong with the simple avocado toast or guacamole, but if you’re wanting to expand your repertoire, here are some of our favorites recipes featuring avocados for every meal of the day. (P.S. – when your avocados are going bad, just peel them, slice them and freeze them for your smoothies.  They are creamy and delicious.)
