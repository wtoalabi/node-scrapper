"Let me guess. Your gym bag probably contains your workout clothes, those cross trainer shoes, your water bottle, a gym log or food journal, cool tunes (and something to play them on), a fitness timer and a towel for sweaty you post-workout. Am I close? All of those cool fitness tools tossed into your gym bag help you work on that healthy body of yours, so don’t you want to give them a fashionable home? Here are 10 of my absolute favorite gym bags. Warning, these bags are so fun they are known to cause spontaneous trips to the gym. (You know, just so you can sling that bag over your shoulder and look fabulous on your way in …) Fashion, fitness and fun all in one gym bag choice! So go get your gym thing on with one of these bags!
