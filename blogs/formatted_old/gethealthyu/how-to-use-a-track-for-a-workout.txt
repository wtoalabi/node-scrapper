"Do you ever drive or walk by a high school track this time of year and watch the athletes out working, sweating, cheering, and laughing? They work their butts offs. Literally. But they have a great time doing it. And do you ever wish, just a little bit, that you were young enough and in good enough shape to be out on the track with them? Here’s your chance. We put together a sweaty track workout that will burn calories and keep boredom at bay (i.e. not just running laps upon laps).
  Other than a few hours after school every day, that track sits open, empty, and just waiting for someone to step onto it and get fired up. Show up at sunrise and hit the pavement. Head out in the evening and sprint into the cool night breeze. Step out on a Saturday morning with a workout buddy and get it done! The track opens up new opportunities to train your body at a higher level and mentally, you will be in tune with the energy of that environment. This workout should take about 20-25 minutes and the only equipment you need is a good pair of shoes and a school’s track. The workout will refer to the “long side” and the “short end.” The long side is the straight portion of the track where the 100-yard dash is run. The “short end” is the curve around the end.
  Oh, and a word to the wise: the “Karaoke” exercise is also known as the grapevine. Now, let’s get running!
