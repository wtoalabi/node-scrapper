  Potentially the biggest buzzword in the beauty world has and always will be “anti-aging.” Firm, plump, moisturized—these are all things we want our skin to embody as we get older. But how do you weed through all the ridiculously overpriced creams, supplements, and pyramid schemes that claim a new mask, peel, or potion will turn back the clock?
  Believe it or not, more and more women are turning to Amazon to buy their anti-aging beauty products, and for good reason! With a site like Amazon or Sephora, you can read hundreds (sometimes thousands) of reviews on a product before purchasing it.
  You can essentially replicate the experience of exchanging anti aging beauty advice with your girlfriends over brunch by purchasing products online.
  Team GHU is no exception; most of us get our anti-aging skincare products from Amazon, too. We got to talking about them in the office the other day and decided to share our favorites with you! So here you have it: some of the best anti-aging finds on Amazon.
  No, this isn’t a paid post or promotion—this is a group of women who love skincare products (and have pretty much tried it all) sharing what’s worked for them.
  
  Anti Wrinkle Serums & Treatments
  Serums and treatments are able to deliver specific anti-aging ingredients that can help your moisturizer work more efficiently. Here are some of our favorites to firm fine lines, even out our skin tone, and restore that youthful glow.
  Zen Med Vitamin C Serum
  
  “I’ve been using this along with the Support Serum for the last five years and it’s been my saving grace for menopausal skin. Glycolic acid used to work for me, but all of the sudden I was getting these white pustules all over my face. The Zen Med serums are the only things that have transformed my skin as I’ve aged.” – Chris
  Chris isn’t the only one who raves about this wonder-product; other reviewers agree that it gave them brighter, younger-looking skin and fought fine lines.
  This is definitely something to add to your cart if you don’t already use a vitamin C serum in your daily beauty routine. Zen Med L-Ascorbic Acid Booster Vitamin C Serum; $39.95
  Sunday Riley Good Genes
  
  “I don’t know anyone who has tried this that hasn’t become obsessed with it. Women in their twenties through their forties looking to get ahead of the aging curve have told me it’s the one skin product they can’t live without, and pretty much all of my friends have gotten hooked on it” – Claire
  This lactic acid treatment has developed a cult-like following for its ability to exfoliate dead skin cells and reveal fresh, perkier skin in an instant.
  While this anti wrinkle treatment is definitely on the pricey side, a bottle of Good Genes will do what its name promises: give you a youthful radiance by plumping up fine lines and reducing hyper-pigmentation. Good Genes; $101.98
  Glytone Rejuvinating Cream
  
  “Glytone is the one thing I consistently re-order for my skin; you start with Step 1 and progress to Step 3 as your skin gets used to it. It’s amazing for anti-aging.” – Kate
  Glytone exfoliates dead skin cells to promote cell turnover and diminish wrinkles while evening out your complexion. Be sure to start with Step 1, as Kate recommends, so your skin gets used to it as you work your way up to Step 3. Glytone Rejuvenating Cream; $53.00
  Moisturizers
  A good moisturizer is a girl’s best friend at any age, but after menopause certain factors become increasingly important, like sun protection, extra hydration, and brightening. Here are three that have stolen our hearts and our shopping carts.
  Zen Med Oil-Free Moisturizer
  
  “I love the Zen Med Oil Free Moisturizer with SPF 30; I put it on every morning for moisturization and sun protection.” – Chris
  
  Protecting your skin from further sun damage is critical to slow down the aging process, as is moisturizing! This oil-free formula is light and sheer while still being nourishing. It provides a great base for makeup, too, since it’s not overly greasy. Zen Med Oil-Free Moisturizer; $27.95
  Tony Moly Gold Snail Cream
  
  
  “This moisturizer makes your skin super smooth and soft, plus it helps fade dark spots and blemishes.” – Amanda
  Ok, ok, we realize putting snails on your face might not sound appealing, but hear us out. Snail filtration is a popular ingredient in tons of Korean skincare products, and now that Western markets are catching on, we can see why. Snail filtrate naturally contains ingredients which stimulate the skin’s production of collagen, repair the skin and provide unparalleled moisturization. So before you turn your nose up at snails in your skin cream, try this product. You’ll see what we mean. Tony Moly Gold Snail Cream; $55.50
  L’Occitane Immortelle Divine Cream
  
  “This cream is an incredible moisturizer; using it twice a day leaves your skin completely nourished and glowing.” – Katie 
  Heralded as a game-changer for mature skin, this decadent but lightweight cream is made with plant-derived ingredients and smells lovely. Over time, it reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while delivering ample hydration for dry or mature faces. L’Occitane Immortelle Divine Cream; $110
  Masks
  Beyond a serum, treatment, or moisturizer, there’s the mask: the thing we turn to when we need a little extra oomph. When we have a little extra time. When we want that extra glow. Here are the best of Amazon’s mask selection, perfectly curated for you. Now get masking!
  Dr. Jart Vital Hydra Solution Masks
  
  “These masks are the best for dry, winter months. I can literally feel my face drink up this liquid.” – Claire
  Dr. Jart’s entire line of sheet masks are winners, but this one in particular works for restoring moisture and life into dull, dry skin. This mask works with your own body heat to penetrate deep into your skin and leave your face moisturized and glowing. Dr. Jart Vital Hydra Solution Masks; $14.50
  Tony Moly I’m Real Sheet Masks
  
  “These masks are ultra-moisturizing and smell delicious. Pop one on and relax for 15 minutes; afterwards, your skin is looks hydrated and glowing!” – Amanda
  If you haven’t jumped aboard the sheet mask bandwagon, you better get on now. These moisturizing masks give you a little bit of luxury for a steal of a price. Just place one of the masks on your face, lay back, and let it do its magic. You’ll reveal glowing, highly-hydrated skin afterwards. Tony Moly I’m Real Sheet Masks; $12.96 for a pack of 11
  Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay
  
  “I’ve tried this a few times and my skin has felt instantly smoother; it makes sense that people rave about this!” – Lexi 
  Whether you’re dealing with uneven skin tone, unexpected menopausal breakouts (yes, a thing) or just clogged pores, this is the creme de la creme of clay masks. It’s one of the best-selling beauty products on Amazon, and our editors rave that it helps firm and clear up troublesome skin. Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay; $10.95
  For Hands
  Hands are one of the first places to show signs of aging, so don’t neglect them! Look for a product with SPF in it that can restore moisture and prevent further damage. Here’s our top pick:
  Deborah Lippman Rich Girl Hand Cream
  
  “I’ve dealt with eczema and other skin conditions my whole life, and a byproduct of that has been dry, discolored skin on my hands. When I started to notice spots on my hands last year, I started using this cream and have noticed a huge difference; my hands feel soft and silky afterwards!” – Claire 
  The first thing to show signs of aging? Your hands. This cream goes on rich and luxurious without leaving a greasy residue, and it instantly softens those paws. Bonus points? It also smells amazing and has SPF 25 to prevent future signs of aging. The cheeky name doesn’t hurt, either. Rich Girl Hand Cream;$28.00
