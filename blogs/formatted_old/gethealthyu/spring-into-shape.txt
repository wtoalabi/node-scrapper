"Spring Break season brings lots of sunshine, sand, and a swimsuit! Are you excited by that last word or did it make you cringe? I think most of us are in that later camp! Winter is all about holidays, hot chocolate, and comfort food. So when the snow finally melts, a few extra pounds are left hanging around. Not this spring! This spring is all about shedding the old you. These “Spring Into Shape” workouts will help you tone and tighten all the trouble spots before the big trip or before wearing that first pair of shorts since September.
  The Beach Bum Workout will perk up your glutes and lean out your legs, Armed and Fabulous is all about rocking strong guns, and Florida Flat Abs will target and tighten your core. For all three workouts, use heavy enough weights that you struggle to complete your last rep. And you’ll notice that these aren’t strictly strength workouts. Cardio bursts are included to help burn fat and reveal the muscles you worked hard to build! Are you ready to shed body fat and spring into shape?
