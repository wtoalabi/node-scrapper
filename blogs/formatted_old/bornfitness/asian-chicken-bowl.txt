"I had my big “aha” cooking moment in 2003 when I was watching Sandra Lee’s semi-homemade series on Food Network. Okay, well, the actual “aha” moment didn’t come until many years later since I was only 19, undergrad, and eating Ramen. The whole idea of the show was combining fresh ingredients with store-bought items. THIS IS GENIUS! Especially if you are juggling a full schedule (or don’t really like to cook), but want to eat healthily.
  Fast forward 18 years and I am still leaning into the semi-homemade technique. Thanks, Sandra!
