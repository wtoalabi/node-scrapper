  Low Carb Jambalaya Ingredients
  
  1lb chicken (thin cut, boneless and skinless). Cut into 1 ” pieces
  4 large sausage links, casing removed and divided into quarter size pieces (hot Italian works great and adds some heat)
  1 large head cauliflower, “riced”
  1 large green bell pepper, diced
  1 jalapeño, finely chopped
  1 medium onion, diced
  2 cloves garlic, minced
  15-18 large shrimp, deveined
  10 oz cherry tomatoes (about 40)
  1 Tbsp olive oil
  Creole seasoning
  
  Directions
  
  Preheat oven to 425.
  Line a baking sheet with foil. Place chicken and sausage on baking sheet.
  Top with prepared vegetables (cauliflower, pepper, jalapeño, onion, garlic). Add a few shakes of Creole seasoning and bake for 10 minutes (veggies will be crisp).
  While the first part of the jambalaya is cooking: Combine shrimp, cherry tomatoes, and olive oil with a few dashes of Creole seasoning in a bowl.
  Add tomato/shrimp mix to the baking sheet and cook for an additional 15 minutes.
  Mix and serve!
