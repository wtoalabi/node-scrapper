"Life should include dessert.
  To help set healthy habits around dessert (or any food) bring more intention.
  Spend time preparing it as an event rather than standing by the freezer with a spoon in the pint of ice cream. Making dessert a ritual instead of a knee-jerk reaction pulls you into the present moment and allows you to experience dessert with all of your senses.
  Bringing Your Intention
  
  Prepare the table by clearing the space, lighting a candle, turned off electronics, turn on music.
  Be hands-on by elevating even simple desserts with elements of fresh fruit, dusting of spices and herbs, or serving on a special plate.
  Invite your friends/family to sit and have a conversation. Conversation cards are great for this!
