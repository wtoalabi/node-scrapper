"If you want a great protein shake, the process isn’t very hard. Tossing together chocolate protein powder + a banana + peanut butter is as simple and delicious as you’ll find. Same goes for vanilla powder + berries. The magic of the protein shake occurs when you stray outside the typical flavors and recreate drinks you love, but in a healthier, protein-packed fashion. Enter: the high-protein piña colada. Sure, there’s no alcohol in this version (although you could arguably add it), but it tastes really good and is surprisingly refreshing. -AB
