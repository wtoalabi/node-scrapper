"Why I love it: This Olive and Quinoa salad combines a savory heart-healthy fat + vegan complete protein + crisp veggies. It can be used as a side dish or a main feature.
  I like to serve it over leafy greens with grilled chicken (not vegan).
  It also stores well in the fridge for leftovers during the week!
  Ingredients:
  
  2 cups quinoa, measure cooked
  1 cup cucumbers, diced
  1 cup kalamata and green pitted olives, halved
  1 cup red bell pepper, diced
  1 tablespoon olive oil
  1 tablespoon red wine or apple cider vinegar
  Salt and pepper (optional)
  
  Directions:
  Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Mix and serve. Itâ€™s that easy!
