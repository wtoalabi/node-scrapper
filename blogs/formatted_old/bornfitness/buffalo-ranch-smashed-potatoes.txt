"The perfect game day appetizer. Pair these crispy taders with your favorite brisket and roasted root vegetable for a full meal.
  Ingredients
  
  2 lbs mini round potatoes (Sometimes called “one bite” potatoes)
  2 Tbsp olive oil
  3 cups baby arugula (you can always add more greens!)
  2 Tbsp reduced-fat feta cheese
  Coarse Salt
  
  Directions
  
  In a large pot add potatoes and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender (can poke easily with a fork).
  Drain and sit for 3 minutes to cool slightly.
  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper then scatter cooked potatoes around the paper.
  Using a flat mallet (or whatever flat utensil you have), press into each potato to smash it flat.
  Drizzle olive oil and course salt on potatoes. Bake for 20-30 minutes at 425 degrees until edges are crispy with a tender center.
  Top with ranch and buffalo sauces (recipes below), arugula, and feta cheese.
