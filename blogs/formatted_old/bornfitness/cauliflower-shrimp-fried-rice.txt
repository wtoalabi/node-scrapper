  1 large crown of cauliflower, run through a food processor to make a fine grain “rice”
  2 cups carrots, diced
  2 cups fish or frozen peas

  2 dozen fresh or frozen shrimp, tails off
  1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce or liquid amino
  
  How to:
  
  In a large skillet, cook garlic and onion in sesame oil on medium heat for 3 minutes.
