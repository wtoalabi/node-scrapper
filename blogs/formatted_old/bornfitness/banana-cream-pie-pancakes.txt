"Confession time. Most high-protein pancake recipes taste artifice to me, but I still wanted to bump my protein up at breakfast.
  Which is why I created these High Protein Banana Cream Pie Pancakes.
  Why I love it: Adding protein from yogurt plus fruit is more filling than just pancakes alone, which means fewer pancakes and more satiating whole food—but doesn’t sacrificing flavor. Tastes like pie.
  Ingredients
  
  Gluten-free pancake mix, cook according to package directions
  1 cup plain Greek Yogurt (I use Kirkland brand with 18g of protein per serving)
  Banana slices
  Drizzle of 100% pure organic maple syrup
  
  Directions
  Layer two 4″ gluten-free pancakes with yogurt. Top with banana slices and a drizzle of pure maple syrup.
