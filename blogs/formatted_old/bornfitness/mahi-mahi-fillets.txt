"The Art of Quick Meals
  The reason many people feel they can eat healthily is they don’t believe they have time to cook.
  And I get it—I am a mom of two, wife, have a job, working on my master’s, plus all the other demands life throws my way.
  It is why I am dedicated to creating easy meals, simple recipes, and sharing shortcuts that I use in my own kitchen.
  Today’s shortcut: Frozen Mahi-Mahi fillets.
  Why I love it: keep them on hand so you are never without a protein source. Mild flavor and don’t taste “fishy” or stink up the house. Mahi-Mahi is “Meaty” and that means filling. They can be thawed in a bowl of cool water in 15 minutes if you forgot to take them out of the freezer (like I ALWAYS do).
  Frozen Mahi-Mahi Fillets Directions
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees
  Place thawed fillet(s) on a lined baking sheet
  Sprinkle both sides with your favorite dry spices (I like webergrill Savory Herbs w/ Roasted Garlic seasoning mix)
  A small hit of butter if that is your jam.
  Cook for 10-12 minutes.
