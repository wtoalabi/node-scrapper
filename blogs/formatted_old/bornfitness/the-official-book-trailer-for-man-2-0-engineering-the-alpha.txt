"Sometimes it’s best for me to say less, and let actions do the talking. In this case, I’ll just let you watch. Here’s the new book trailer for Man 2.0: Engineering The Alpha. A Real World Guide to an Unreal Life. 
  Watch. Enjoy. And get fired up. We’ve written something special for you.
  Before you watch. Consider the following:
  Fun fact #1: I was supposed to be filmed in the sex scenes with my wife. Not sure how much her parents would have liked that.
  Fun fact #2: While bacon is featured in the trailer, I have never consumed bacon. It’s a kosher thing. But bacon is Alpha approved.
