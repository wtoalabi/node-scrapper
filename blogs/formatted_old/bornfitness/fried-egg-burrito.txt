"Burritos are fun, versatile, and easy to make. A single burrito is enough for a whole meal and works for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
  What You Need
  Fried Egg Burrito Ingredients
  
  2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
  1 cup onion, diced
  1 can low sodium black beans, drained (not rinsed)
  1/2 cup pre-cooked rice (leftovers work great for this meal and saves time)
  1 tortilla or burrito wrap (suggested: look for 4g or more of fiber per serving)
  2 eggs, fried (or cooked however you like them)
  Plum tomatoes, diced
  Fresh basil, chopped
  Avocado (optional)
  
  Sauce Ingredients
  1/4 cup non-fat plain Greek Yogurt
  Hot sauce
  2 Tbsp water
  How To
  
  In a skillet on medium heat, soften garlic and onions for 3 minutes. I use a splash of water in place of oil or butter.
  Add black beans. Cook for another 3-5 minutes.
  While veggies are cooking, prepare your eggs the way you like them.
  For the sauce combine yogurt + hot sauce + water.
  Assemble the burrito with a spoonful of rice, a spoonful of black bean mixture, a handful of tomatoes, eggs, basil, sauce.Natalie SabinNatalie is a M.S. in Nutrition & Performance candidate; anticipated completion December 2021.
