"Think 
   of this column as a public access Atomic Dog, a place for the T-mag staff 
   and anyone else to get something off their chests, encourage, inspire, or just 
   go off on a bug-eyed, frothing-at-the-mouth rant. 
  In 
   this installment, Westside Barbell guru Dave Tate digs deep to answer the question, 
   “Why do we put ourselves through this?”
  
  When you’re attempting a 600-pound bench press, things can go wrong fast. I’d 
   just missed 600 for the second time and something was definitely going wrong. 
   “Screw it!” I thought. “Keep the bar loaded!” It was that third miss that really 
   did my shoulder in. Now I had to find out if I was hurt, injured, or fucked 
   up. 
  This 
   is how I define the three stages of injury. When you’re hurt it’s really no 
   big deal. For the powerlifter or any athlete who pushes the envelope with maximal 
   weights, you’re almost always hurt somewhere. This will usually just go away. 
   When you’re injured, it doesn’t go away and may require some time off and rehabilitation 
   work. When things get really bad you become fucked up. This is when things just 
   don’t get better or injuries from long ago keep creeping back in. Now I had 
   to find out what stage I was in. 
  The 
   next bench workout, I couldn’t lower the bar without pain. It was like someone 
   was sticking a knife in my neck. So I trained around it for a few weeks and 
   it didn’t get any better. I knew I was on the line between injured and fucked 
   up. After five months I decided to see a doctor. Five months without benching 
   over 315 was no good, so I knew something had to be wrong. I was told I had 
   four bone spurs that needed to come out and a torn terres major that needed 
   to be fixed. Surgery was scheduled and I was going under the knife (again) in 
   pursuit of a bigger bench. I wondered how long it would take to come back from 
   this one. After a previous surgery for a pec tear, it took over a year to break 
   my PR. 
  During 
   check-in at the hospital, the nurse asked how I injured myself. I told her it 
   was from years of abuse. Then she saw the other surgery on my record and asked 
   if that was also from the weights. Yes, I told her, and why do you ask? In that 
   cold room with nothing on but a damn open-backed gown, she asked the question 
   I couldn’t get out of my head. 
  “Why 
   do you keep doing it?”
   I just laughed it off and was wheeled to the pre-op room. 
  Going 
   in for surgery makes you feel like a convict on death row. Pre-op is the last 
   stop before you reach the chair. The anesthesiologist told me he was going to 
   stick a long needle into my neck. It was the biggest damn needle I’d ever seen 
   and he was going to drill it through my trap. Doctors sometimes make small talk 
   while they do painful things to you, so he asked me how I’d injured myself and 
   I told him. He finished, turned to me and asked, “Why do you keep doing this 
   when you’re as beat up as you are?”
  The 
   same question two times in the last half-hour. I laughed it off again, but this 
   time the question stuck with me. As they rolled me into the operating room, 
   I saw my doctor standing there. I was in la-la land by this time, but still 
   had the presence of mind to tell the doctor to take care of me. He had my life 
   in his hands, after all. He reassured me he’d done this thousands of times and 
   hadn’t lost a patient yet. Hadn’t lost anyone? Hell, I wasn’t literally 
   talking about my life, I was talking about my ability to bench! Couldn’t he 
   see how important this was to me? 
  I 
   was instructed to count backward from ten. Ten… nine… and as I drifted 
   off… eight… that question came back into my mind… seven… 
   Why do I do this?… six… and I was gone….
  ….back 
   into the gym, with that same question ringing in my head. As I walked in I noticed 
   a certain smell to the place. A special blend of sweat, chalk, silicone spray, 
   and liniment. This is the same smell you find in any hardcore gym. The smell 
   of hard work, pain, and discipline. The smell of courage. To a true lifter this 
   is the smell of home, the place you want to be. I thought to myself, “Could 
   this be it? Could this smell be what it’s all about?”<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/210_bw1.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"250\"/>While 
   waiting for our regular start time of 8:30AM, I began the process of applying 
   the liniment. During this time my training partners are also arriving. They’re 
   joking, talking trash, making bets, catching up. During the warm-up I wonder 
   if this is what it’s all about, if this is why I do it. Is this kinship with 
   my training partners the real answer?
  At 
   8:30 the attitude of the gym changes. It goes from comedy and friendship to 
   aggression and war. The first movement of the session is the most important. 
   This is the real deal, the lift we try to break records on, the one that you 
   will kill or it will kill you. The music is turned from the radio to something 
   more hardcore. DMX, AC/DC, it really doesn’t matter as long as it’s loud. I 
   feel my heart rate begin to speed up and the aggression building. I see that 
   look of aggression in everyone’s eyes. If you were to walk into the gym at this 
   point in time not knowing what was going on, it’d be best to turn the hell around 
   and come back later. As I looked at my surroundings I thought, “Could this be 
   it? Could the music and aggression be the reason why I do what I do?”
  As 
   we start the max effort movement we begin with light weights and work up to 
   the “courage weight,” the actual max weight. As I grip the bar I feel the cold 
   metal in my hands. The sharp knurling brings a little pain to my callused hands, 
   the hands that have spent a lifetime with the iron. The feeling of the bar brings 
   on the excitement of striving to get to the big weights, the weights only some 
   will ever achieve, the place where only those who know how to dream big will 
   ever get. Could this be it? Could the feel of steel be the reason why I do what 
   I do? Could the training under maximal strain be the reason why I do it? Is 
   it the shouts of encouragement as I attempt a new PR? Or do I do it for the 
   rage and the release that only heavy lifting can provide? <img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/210_bw2.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"/>After 
   everyone does their lifts, it’s my turn again. I tell them that I’m done for 
   the day, but the words come back to me like a knife in the back. What the hell 
   do you mean you’re done? Put on a quarter and get the hell under the bar! This 
   time I have to dig deep inside and pull out another person to deal with this 
   shit. Dave is not made for this, but my alter ego is. We call him Zippy, and 
   Zippy gets the job done when Dave checks out. 
  So 
   I dig down inside and find that other person and he approaches the bar. The 
   focus on the task cancels out everything else that’s going on. While getting 
   under the weight I feel my heart pounding in my chest and the aggression and 
   rage is at an all time high. As the weight is unracked there’s no doubt in my 
   mind that I’ll crush this weight. Could this be it? Could lifting a weight I 
   first thought would kill me be the reason why I put myself through all this? 
   Could the blood, sweat and tears of training be the reason why I do what I do?
  Now 
   I’m at the IPA Nationals walking through the warm-up room. You can feel the 
   excitement growing. Gym bags are scattered throughout and there are lifters 
   everywhere. Teens, masters, amateurs, and pros all mix together. The sport of 
   powerlifting has a place for everyone. All of them are looking forward to their 
   time of judgment, their moment of truth. As I look around and see friends I’ve 
   made over the years and new friends I’ll be making on this day, I wonder again, 
   Could this be it? Could being among all those who love the iron as much as I 
   do be the reason why I do this? 
  Now 
   I’m at a meet, in the hole and waiting. This is the day you train for, the moment 
   in time that once over, nobody can ever take from you and can never be relived. 
   To a lifter this is his shining moment, the moment that’ll determine if the 
   work was done in the gym or not. If you did your work and it was the right work, 
   this moment will be one of the greatest of the year. If you didn’t do your work, 
   then this will serve as a constant reminder of where you went wrong, a learning 
   experience that can make you better. 
  I’m 
   on deck now, one lifter out, getting wrapped and suited up for a big squat. 
   Am I ready for the task at hand? Is my mind in the right place? I’m surrounded 
   by a potent mixture of encouragement and high-octane aggression. My name is 
   called and it’s time to turn it on. This is where I want to be. This is what 
   I train for. Here it’s all up to you; no one can lift the weight for you. Fear 
   is not an option. This is the day you spit in the face of fear and drive on. 
   It’s time to release to rage. 
  The 
   weight is laughing at me as I step under the bar, but it feels light. The game 
   is already over. I know already who the winner is going to be on this day. Two 
   seconds later, with a nose full of blood and stars in my eyes, I rack the weight 
   and three white lights ignite as bright as the Vegas strip. A new PR. A weight 
   I only dreamed of lifting ten years ago. Could this be it? Is this why…<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/210_bw3.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\"/>…and 
   someone is saying my name again and again. The doctor. I’m in the recovery room 
   and doped out of my mind. Later, on the way home, the answer to the question 
   hits me like a ton of bricks. I do what I do because this is what I do. 
   It’s not the smell of the gym. I’ve been in many gyms and loved them all. They 
   all didn’t have the same smell. It’s not my training partners. Training partners 
   come and go. It’s not the cold steel or feel of the bar. Some bars are fatter 
   than others, some are thin, some have less knurling while others are sharp as 
   hell. I love the feel of them all. 
  It’s 
   not the strain and it’s not the music in the gym. Music changes with time but 
   my passion stays the same. It’s not the old and new friends that are met and 
   made at competitions. Friends come and go; lifters retire and quit. It’s not 
   the personal records that are set in the meets. If this was the case I would’ve 
   quit a long time ago. In twenty years of competing I think there may have been 
   only three meets were I broke a PR in every lift. 
  So 
   what is it? Why do I do what I do? It’s not one thing or one moment. It’s the process I have the passion for. It’s all of it. I love it all and this 
   is why I do what I do. Twenty years ago, a thirteen year old kid picked up a Powerlifting USA magazine and dreamed of being in the top ten. On this 
   day the passion began and the quest started. Twenty years later this kid still 
   hadn’t let go of his childhood dreams and posted a top ten total. 
  When 
   someone asks you why you do what you do, just grin. We do what we do because 
   this is what we do. Our passion has built our character, and our character 
   defines us. Never lose your passion.<img src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/210_bw4.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"317\"/>One
