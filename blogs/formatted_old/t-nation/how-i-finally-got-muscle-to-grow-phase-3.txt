"In the first and second parts of this three-phase program, I outlined the exact workouts I use for the Strength Phase and the Volume Phase. Now let’s look at the next 10-day phase: Intensity. Or as I like to call it, insanity.
  In my program, the word intensity means supersets, drop sets, rest/pause, tempo manipulation, partial reps, forced reps, and working to failure – all the things that bring as much blood as possible to the muscle and make it burn. The bigger the pump, the better! It’s funny, but I used to hate the pump. I wondered why I should bother with such little weights, but let’s just say I’ve learned a lot since then.
  It might look a little crazy, but remember that you only have to do this workout one week out of every three. However, each time you do it, it’ll shock the body into a new level of growth.
