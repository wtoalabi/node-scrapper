"Here’s what you need to know…
  
  Your trapezius isn’t just that meaty part surrounding your neck. It extends from head to mid back.
  Your traps retract, depress, and help to upwardly rotate the scapula: all of which are heavily involved in weight training.
  Weak lower and middle traps will make you more vulnerable to upper body lifting injuries like shoulder impingement.
  Direct trap training works better than compound movements when it comes to hypertrophy.
  Strengthening the traps helps athletes avoid injury and it helps powerlifters increase their lifts.
  
  Form and Function
  Few things espouse more masculinity than a set of mountainous traps. But most lifters train their traps insufficiently from both an aesthetic and functional standpoint.
  The trapezius plays critical roles in preventing shoulder and neck injuries as well as in pressing performance.
  Trapezius Function

  Think the traps are just for shrugging?
  The trapezius, originates from the external occipital protuberance (the back of your skull) and attaches to the ligamentum nuchae (your spine). It connects to the spinous processes behind the neck all the way down to the mid-back.
  The upper traps, which many novice lifters wrongly assume is the entire muscle, inserts into the lateral third of the clavicle and into the acromion of the shoulder. It elevates the scapula for upward rotation.
  The middle and lower traps join the rhomboids inserting into the spine of the scapula to retract them. It pulls the scapula back during movements such as rowing and climbing, and will enable a lifter to keep a stable upper back during horizontal and overhead pressing exercises.
  The lower traps also assist with upward rotation of the scapula, which occurs anytime you raise your arms overhead.
  Trap Training: Hypertrophy Benefits
  Larger traps provide an illusionary effect. Check out the physiques on lightweight boxers, wrestlers, and mixed martial artists and you’ll see astounding upper trap development in spite of their low body weight.
  Novice lifters often say they’re getting enough trap work with deadlifts, rows, and squats, but when I’ve trained clients with hypertrophic goals in mind, the traps have immense growth potential that’s not realized without direct training. So why not train them directly?
  Trap Training: Performance Benefits

  For lifters with injury prevention in mind, such as athletes who engage in contact sports, trap training has crucial. Unresolved whiplash symptoms and chronic neck pain have been linked to trapezius weakness.
  Weaker trapezius muscles, specifically the middle and lower trapezius, can beget shoulder impingement syndrome, scapular winging, and scapular dyskinesis.
  Trap Training: Powerlifting Benefits
  Relevant to powerlifting or those desiring a bigger bench, shoulder impingement and dyskinesis will alter normal functioning of the glenohumeral joint, thus throwing a wrench in one’s bench-pressing progress.
  Also, remember that stronger traps translate to bigger pulls. A lifter with strong lower traps will be able to pull the scapulae back and down during a deadlift or row, thus keeping the bar from traveling too far from the body. Strong upper traps will help lifters with their deadlift lockout, again keeping the bar closer to the body.
  Trap Training: Desk Jockey Benefits
  Paper pushers and online coaches need trap training too. Aside from just yoking-up their necks, trap training will give them better posture. It’ll help address scapular instability, and it’ll ward off the common upper back and neck pain associated with being anchored to a desk for the bulk of the work day.
  Trap Training Considerations

  Prioritize trap training. Do it at the beginning of your workout. Since these areas are never worked with high volume or to failure in strength programs, you won’t have to worry about their training affecting performance on subsequent lifts like the Olympic lifts or squats, presses, and rows.
  When I’ve had lifters train these groups through stretching and performing isometric holds, it’s been easier for them to get into a neutral neck position during lifts occurring later in the workout. And shrugging heavier loads in lower volumes will prime the CNS for the work that’s yet to come.
  Upper Trap Exercises
  Nothing is more yawn-worthy than seeing “Barbell Shrug 3 x 10” in a workout program. If you have the flexibility in your program, or equipment, try these upper trap variations instead.
  Dumbbell Jump Shrug
   Barbell Shrug Walk
   Dumbbell Shrug Walk
   Dumbbell Saw Shrug
   Plate Saw Shrug
   Seated One-Arm Dumbbell Shrug
   One-Armed Smith Machine Shrug
   Unilateral Low Pulley Shoulder Extension Shrug
  Note: Unilateral shrugging exercises were found to produce the greatest EMG activity in the upper trapezius.
   Banded Lateral Raise to Shrug
   Lower and Middle Trap Exercises
  For the oft-neglected middle and lower aspects of the trapezius, throw these movements in along with your upper trap work:
  Mini Range Lat Pull-Down to Isometric Hold
   Voyeur Shrug
   Half T-Raise
   
  <img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://d3h9ln6psucegz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/half-t-raise.jpg\" alt=\"half-t-raise\" />
  
  These work wonders in recruiting the middle and lower traps. EMG activity in the middle and lower trapezius is greatest during shoulder external rotation and flexion in the prone position.
  Alternating Forearm Wall Slide
   Prone Tennis Ball Tension I, Y, T Raises
   Standing Calf Raise Shrug
   Trap Stretch
  Add these to the end of your trap work for an intense stretch.
